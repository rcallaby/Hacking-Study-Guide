# Security Policy

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive study guide for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and related cybersecurity topics. It includes notes, checklists, tools overviews, and resources aimed at supporting learners preparing for certifications such as eJPT, PNTP, and OSCP. While this is primarily an educational and documentation-based project without executable code, we prioritize the accuracy and security implications of the content provided. Misinformation or outdated advice in this guide could inadvertently lead to real-world security risks if applied incorrectly. As such, we encourage responsible reporting of any issues to help maintain the integrity and usefulness of this resource.

All content is intended for educational purposes only and must be used in compliance with applicable laws and ethical guidelines. We do not endorse or support any illegal activities.

## Supported Versions

This repository does not follow a traditional software versioning scheme, as it consists of evolving documentation and notes. The content is continuously updated based on community contributions, feedback, and advancements in the field. We recommend always using the latest version from the `main` branch for the most current information.

## Reporting a Vulnerability or Content Issue

If you identify any of the following in this repository, please report it promptly:
- Inaccuracies or outdated information that could mislead users into insecure practices.
- Potential security vulnerabilities in any linked resources, tools, or examples (e.g., if a recommended tool has known exploits).
- Sensitive content that should be redacted or handled differently.
- Any other issues related to the security or ethical implications of the guide.

### How to Report
- **Public Reports**: For non-sensitive issues (e.g., general inaccuracies), open a GitHub issue in this repository. Use the "Bug report" or "Content suggestion" template if available, and label it with "security" or "content-issue" for visibility.
- **Private Reports**: For sensitive matters that should not be disclosed publicly (e.g., details that could be exploited if shared openly), contact the maintainer directly via email at richard@richardcallaby.com or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature if enabled.

### What to Expect
- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within 3-5 business days.
- **Investigation**: We will review the issue and may request additional details.
- **Resolution**: If the report is accepted, we will update the content, credit you (if desired), and notify you of the changes. If declined, we will provide a clear explanation (e.g., if it's out of scope or already addressed).
- **Timeline**: Non-critical updates will be addressed within 14 days; urgent security-related fixes will be prioritized immediately.
- **Bounty or Rewards**: This is a personal educational project, so no formal bug bounty program exists. However, significant contributions may be recognized in the repository's acknowledgments or CONTRIBUTORS.md file.
