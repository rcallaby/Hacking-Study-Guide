# IDOR Insecure Direct Object References

As a penetration tester, identifying and exploiting IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References) is a critical aspect of evaluating the security of web applications. IDOR vulnerabilities occur when an application provides direct access to sensitive objects, such as records in a database, without proper authorization checks. This can allow attackers to manipulate URLs to access or modify sensitive data that they shouldn't have access to.

To identify IDOR vulnerabilities, a penetration tester would typically begin by performing a comprehensive assessment of the application's behavior and functionality. This may involve analyzing the source code, testing the application manually, and using automated tools to scan for potential vulnerabilities.

Once an IDOR vulnerability has been identified, a penetration tester can exploit it by modifying the parameters in a URL to access or manipulate sensitive objects directly. For example, in an application that displays user information, a tester could change the user ID parameter in the URL to access information for another user without proper authentication.

It is important for a penetration tester to understand the implications of exploiting an IDOR vulnerability. Depending on the nature and sensitivity of the data being accessed, exploitation of an IDOR vulnerability could lead to serious consequences, such as theft of confidential information, financial loss, or damage to a company's reputation.

To mitigate IDOR vulnerabilities, application developers should implement proper authorization checks, such as verifying that the user has the necessary permissions before allowing access to sensitive objects. Penetration testers can also provide recommendations to improve the security of the application and help prevent IDOR vulnerabilities from being exploited.

As a penetration tester, identifying and exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities is a key part of ensuring the security of web applications. By performing comprehensive assessments and exploiting vulnerabilities, penetration testers can help organizations secure their systems and prevent sensitive information from being compromised.

Imagine a web application that displays information about employees, including their name, job title, and salary. To access this information, the user simply needs to navigate to a URL with the employee ID as a parameter, such as "https://example.com/employee?id=123".

In a secure application, the application would verify that the user is authorized to access this information before displaying it. However, in an application with an IDOR vulnerability, the authorization check is missing, and any user can access the information for any employee simply by changing the ID parameter in the URL. For example, if a user changes the URL to "https://example.com/employee?id=456", they could access the information for another employee without proper authentication.

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to access sensitive information, such as the salary and job title of other employees, and potentially use that information for malicious purposes. To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should implement proper authorization checks, such as verifying that the user is authorized to access the information for the specified employee ID before displaying it.
