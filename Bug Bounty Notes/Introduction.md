# Bug Bounty Notes

Bug bounty hunting is a method of identifying and reporting vulnerabilities in software and applications, typically used by companies and organizations to improve their cybersecurity. The principle behind bug bounty hunting is simple: incentivize ethical hackers, also known as "white hat" hackers, to find and report vulnerabilities in a company's systems and software, in exchange for a reward.

## Key Benefits of Bug Bounty programs

One of the key benefits of bug bounty hunting is that it allows companies to identify vulnerabilities that may have gone unnoticed by their own internal security teams. This is because ethical hackers, who participate in bug bounty programs, come from a wide range of backgrounds and have diverse skillsets, which allows them to identify vulnerabilities that may have been missed by a company's internal security team.

Another benefit of bug bounty hunting is that it can help to quickly identify and address vulnerabilities, before they can be exploited by malicious actors. This is because ethical hackers are incentivized to report vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered, rather than waiting to exploit them for personal gain.

The process of bug bounty hunting typically begins with a company or organization announcing a bug bounty program, which outlines the scope of the program, the types of vulnerabilities that are being sought, and the rewards that will be offered for the discovery of different types of vulnerabilities.

## How do bug bounty programs work?

Once a bug bounty program is announced, ethical hackers can begin searching for vulnerabilities in the company's systems and software. When a vulnerability is discovered, the ethical hacker will typically report it to the company's security team, who will then verify the vulnerability and determine the appropriate course of action.

The rewards offered for the discovery of vulnerabilities can vary widely, depending on the severity of the vulnerability and the company offering the bug bounty. Some companies offer monetary rewards, while others may offer recognition or other non-monetary rewards.
