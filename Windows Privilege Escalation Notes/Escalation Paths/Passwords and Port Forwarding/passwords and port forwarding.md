<strong>Passwords and Port Forwarding</strong>

Similar to finding passwords in Linux some of the same methods to locate passwords in Windows can also be used. This is somewhat a good thing in that the mentality of finding passwords shouldn't be too difficult if you have mastered finding passwords in Linux.

People like to store their passwords in text files, or in other forms right on their computer. That is because people are by and large lazy and also negligent when it comes to their own cyber security and also to the security of the company or business they work for.
