# Executable Files

There are services that have executables attached to them. Some of these services are run as administrator as default. This is your path to escalate paths in Windows.

You will want to run powerup to be able to execute this path.

As a penetration tester, executable files can be a valuable asset in your arsenal. In this article, we'll explore what executable files are, why they're useful, and provide a step-by-step guide on how you can use them in your penetration testing activities.

## What are executable files?

An executable file is a file that contains instructions that a computer can execute. These files typically have a .exe file extension, but can also have other file extensions such as .dll, .bat, .com, .vbs, and .js. Executable files can be written in various programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python.

## Why are executable files useful in penetration testing?

Executable files can be used in penetration testing to simulate attacks and test the security of a system. They can be used to exploit vulnerabilities, escalate privileges, or gain access to sensitive information. For example, an attacker may use a malicious executable file to gain access to a victim's computer or network and steal sensitive data.

## Using executable files in penetration testing

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can use executable files in your penetration testing activities:

+ Gather information about the target system
The first step in any penetration testing activity is to gather information about the target system. This can include information about the operating system, network topology, and installed software. This information can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited using executable files.

+ Identify potential attack vectors
Based on the information gathered in step 1, identify potential attack vectors that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the target system. For example, if the target system is running an outdated version of a web server, a malicious executable file could be used to exploit known vulnerabilities in the web server software.

+ Develop a plan of attack
Based on the attack vectors identified in step 2, develop a plan of attack. This plan should include the executable files that will be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the target system.

+ Develop or obtain executable files
Once you have a plan of attack, you can start developing or obtaining the executable files that will be used in the attack. This can include developing custom executable files or obtaining pre-built ones from sources such as exploit databases.

+ Test the executable files in a safe environment
Before using the executable files in a live attack, it's important to test them in a safe environment. This can include using a virtual machine or a test system that is not connected to a network.

+ Execute the attack
Once the executable files have been tested and refined, it's time to execute the attack on the target system. This should be done with caution and in a controlled manner to minimize the risk of causing damage to the target system or network.

Executable files can be a powerful tool in a penetration tester's arsenal. They can be used to simulate attacks and test the security of a system. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can use executable files effectively in your penetration testing activities. However, it's important to always use caution and follow ethical guidelines to avoid causing damage or harm to the target system or network.
