# Service Permissions

As a penetration tester, one of the most important aspects of the job is to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited to escalate privileges on a system. One common area that is often overlooked is service permissions in Windows. In this article, we will explore what service permissions are, how they work, and provide a step-by-step guide on how to exploit them to escalate privileges.

## What are Service Permissions?

In Windows, a service is a program that runs in the background and performs specific functions. These services can be started and stopped by the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM) and are governed by a set of permissions. Service permissions determine who can perform certain actions on a service, such as starting or stopping it, modifying its configuration, or even deleting it.

## How Service Permissions Work

Service permissions are managed by the Windows Access Control List (ACL) system. Each service has an associated security descriptor that contains the service's permissions. The security descriptor consists of an access control list (ACL) that lists the users and groups that are allowed to perform various actions on the service. The permissions are defined by a set of access control entries (ACEs) that specify which users or groups are granted or denied specific permissions.

For example, a service may have an ACE that grants the "start" permission to the "Administrators" group and denies the "stop" permission to the "Users" group. This means that only members of the "Administrators" group can start the service, and members of the "Users" group cannot stop the service.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Exploiting Service Permissions

+ Identify a vulnerable service
The first step in exploiting service permissions is to identify a vulnerable service. This can be done using tools such as Microsoft's "sc.exe" command or third-party tools such as "Sysinternals Process Explorer". Look for services that are running with high privileges, such as "LocalSystem", "NetworkService", or "Administrators".

+ Enumerate the service permissions
Once you have identified a vulnerable service, the next step is to enumerate its permissions. This can be done using tools such as Microsoft's "sc.exe" command or the "AccessChk" tool from Sysinternals. Look for any permissions that allow a non-administrative user to perform a privileged action on the service, such as starting or stopping it.

+ Exploit the service permissions
If you have identified a service with vulnerable permissions, the final step is to exploit those permissions to escalate privileges. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as modifying the service's configuration, replacing the service executable with a malicious one, or using a tool such as "PowerSploit" to exploit the service's vulnerability.

## Conclusion

Service permissions are an often-overlooked area of Windows security that can be exploited by a skilled penetration tester to escalate privileges. By identifying vulnerable services, enumerating their permissions, and exploiting those permissions, a penetration tester can gain elevated privileges on a system and access sensitive data. It is important for system administrators to regularly review and update service permissions to prevent these types of attacks.
