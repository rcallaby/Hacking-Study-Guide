Seatbelt is a penetration testing tool used to enumerate and extract valuable information from a target system. It was developed by a security researcher named Tom Hudson, and it is designed to be used primarily by penetration testers and bug bounty hunters. Seatbelt has quickly become a popular tool among the security community due to its ability to quickly gather system information and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## What does Seatbelt do?
Seatbelt has a wide range of features, including:

User enumeration: Seatbelt can enumerate all users and groups on a target system, along with their privileges and group memberships.

Application information: Seatbelt can identify installed applications and their versions, along with their install locations.

Browser information: Seatbelt can extract data from the target system's installed browsers, such as saved passwords, cookies, and history.

Network information: Seatbelt can extract information about the target system's network configuration, including IP addresses, DNS servers, and network interfaces.

Security-related information: Seatbelt can identify installed antivirus software and their versions, as well as any firewalls or other security-related software running on the target system.

Scheduled tasks: Seatbelt can list all scheduled tasks running on the target system and their associated privileges.

## How does Seatbelt work?
Seatbelt is a command-line tool written in C#. It uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to gather information from the target system. WMI is a Microsoft technology that allows for the management of Windows-based systems using a standardized approach.

Seatbelt can be run locally on a Windows-based system, or it can be run remotely using tools like PsExec. When run, Seatbelt will execute a series of commands to gather information from the target system, such as querying the Windows registry, listing installed applications, and retrieving network information.

## Examples of how to use Seatbelt
Here are some examples of how to use Seatbelt in a penetration testing or bug bounty hunting scenario:

User enumeration: Run Seatbelt with the "--users" flag to enumerate all users and groups on the target system.

Application information: Run Seatbelt with the "--applications" flag to identify all installed applications on the target system, including their versions and install locations.

Browser information: Run Seatbelt with the "--browser" flag to extract data from the target system's installed browsers, such as saved passwords, cookies, and history.

Network information: Run Seatbelt with the "--network" flag to extract information about the target system's network configuration, including IP addresses, DNS servers, and network interfaces.

Security-related information: Run Seatbelt with the "--security" flag to identify installed antivirus software and their versions, as well as any firewalls or other security-related software running on the target system.

Scheduled tasks: Run Seatbelt with the "--scheduledtasks" flag to list all scheduled tasks running on the target system and their associated privileges.

Seatbelt is a powerful and versatile penetration testing tool that can quickly gather valuable information from a target system. It is a valuable addition to any penetration tester's toolkit, and it can help bug bounty hunters identify potential vulnerabilities in a target system. Seatbelt's ease of use and comprehensive feature set make it an excellent tool for both novice and experienced security professionals alike.
