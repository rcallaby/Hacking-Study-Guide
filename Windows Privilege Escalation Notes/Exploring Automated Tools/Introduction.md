<strong>Introduction</strong>

There are many automated tools that you can use to help you gain a foothold in Windows, some of these tools are free but of course some of the better tools are paid. What you choose to use is really dependent upon what exam you are studying for and also what your employer, if you have one, is willing to spend on to help you do your job.

As you might imagine these tools vary by what they are capable of doing. Some tools may give far better results than others, and sometimes they may give conflicting results. The point here is to use your brain as your deciding factor in what actually may be a vulnerability as opposed to a false positive.
