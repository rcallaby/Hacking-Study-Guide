# GitHub OSINT

GitHub is a popular platform for developers to collaborate on code repositories, and it is also a goldmine for penetration testers who are looking for open-source intelligence (OSINT) about their target. In this article, we will discuss GitHub OSINT from the perspective of a penetration tester, including what it is, how to do it, the tools used, and a step-by-step guide.

## What is GitHub OSINT?
GitHub OSINT is the process of using GitHub to gather information about a target, such as their code repositories, collaborators, and other data that can be useful for a penetration tester. GitHub OSINT can be used to find vulnerabilities in a target's code, identify potential attack vectors, and gather intelligence for social engineering attacks.

## How to do GitHub OSINT?
The first step in GitHub OSINT is to identify your target. This can be done by researching the target's website, social media profiles, or other online resources. Once you have identified your target, you can start searching for their code repositories on GitHub. You can use GitHub's search feature to find repositories by keyword, user, or organization.

Once you have found the target's code repositories, you can start analyzing the code to identify vulnerabilities. You can also look at the repository's commit history to see when changes were made and who made them. This information can be used to identify potential collaborators or insiders who may have access to sensitive information.

## Tools used for GitHub OSINT
There are several tools available for conducting GitHub OSINT, including:

1. GitRob
GitRob is an open-source tool that can be used to search GitHub for sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and other secrets. GitRob can be used to find vulnerabilities in a target's code or to gather intelligence for social engineering attacks.

2. TruffleHog
TruffleHog is another open-source tool that can be used to search GitHub for secrets, such as API keys and passwords. TruffleHog can be used to find vulnerabilities in a target's code and to identify potential attack vectors.

3. GitGraber
GitGraber is an open-source tool that can be used to search GitHub for sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and other secrets. GitGraber can be used to find vulnerabilities in a target's code and to gather intelligence for social engineering attacks.

## Step-by-Step Guide to GitHub OSINT
Here is a step-by-step guide to conducting GitHub OSINT:

+ Step 1: Identify your target
Identify your target by researching their website, social media profiles, or other online resources.

+ Step 2: Search for code repositories
Use GitHub's search feature to find repositories by keyword, user, or organization.

+ Step 3: Analyze the code
Analyze the code to identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors. Look at the commit history to see when changes were made and who made them.

+ Step 4: Use OSINT tools
Use OSINT tools like GitRob, TruffleHog, and GitGraber to search for sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys.

+ Step 5: Gather intelligence
Use the information you have gathered to identify potential collaborators, insiders, and attack vectors.

GitHub OSINT is a valuable technique for penetration testers who are looking for open-source intelligence about their target. By searching GitHub for code repositories and analyzing the code, penetration testers can identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors. Additionally, tools like GitRob, TruffleHog, and GitGraber can be used to search for sensitive information that can be useful for social engineering attacks. By following the steps outlined in this article, penetration testers can conduct effective GitHub OSINT and gather valuable intelligence about their target.
