# SnapChat OSINT

Snapchat is a popular social media platform that allows users to share photos, videos, and messages with each other. As a penetration tester, one of the ways to gather information about a target is through OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques. In this article, we'll explore what Snapchat OSINT is, how to perform it, and the tools used to carry out the process.

## What is Snapchat OSINT?

Snapchat OSINT is the process of using publicly available information on Snapchat to gather intelligence about a target. This could include identifying potential targets for phishing attacks, gathering information for social engineering attacks, or identifying potential vulnerabilities in an organization's security.

The information gathered through Snapchat OSINT could include the user's name, username, email address, phone number, and even their location. Additionally, a penetration tester can use Snapchat OSINT to identify the user's contacts, their interests, and their behavior on the platform.

## How to perform Snapchat OSINT?

Snapchat OSINT can be performed by anyone with basic knowledge of the platform and its features. Here are some steps to follow when performing Snapchat OSINT:

Create a fake account: The first step is to create a fake Snapchat account. This is necessary to avoid leaving any traceable footprints when gathering information. The account should be created using a different name, email address, and phone number from the target's account.

Add the target: After creating the fake account, the next step is to add the target's account. This can be done by searching for their username or by scanning their Snapcode.

Gather information: Once the target has been added, the next step is to gather information about them. This can be done by viewing their stories, snaps, and chats. It is important to be cautious not to interact with their content or let them know that you're gathering information.

Analyze the information: After gathering the information, the next step is to analyze it. This could include identifying the user's interests, behaviors, and even their location. This information can be used to create a social engineering attack or identify potential vulnerabilities in an organization's security.

## Tools used for Snapchat OSINT

Several tools can be used to perform Snapchat OSINT. Here are some of the most popular ones:

SnapMap: SnapMap is a feature in Snapchat that allows users to see the location of their friends on a map. It can be used to gather information about the target's location and their contacts.

Snapdex: Snapdex is a directory of Snapchat usernames that can be used to find a user's username.

GhostCodes: GhostCodes is a directory of Snapchat users categorized by interests. It can be used to find potential targets for social engineering attacks.

Snaptool: Snaptool is a tool that allows users to view and download Snapchat stories anonymously. It can be used to gather information about the target's behavior on the platform.

Conclusion

Snapchat OSINT is a useful technique for gathering intelligence about a target on the popular social media platform. It can be used by penetration testers to identify potential vulnerabilities in an organization's security or to create social engineering attacks. By following the steps outlined in this article and using the tools mentioned, you can successfully gather information about a target on Snapchat. However, it's important to note that Snapchat OSINT should be used ethically and only with the target's consent.
