# Reddit OSINT

As a penetration tester, one of the key skills you need to have is the ability to gather information about your target. This process is known as Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and involves gathering information from publicly available sources such as social media, news articles, and online forums. In this article, we will explore how you can use Reddit for OSINT purposes, including the tools you need and a step-by-step guide.

+ Step 1: Define Your Scope
Before you start your OSINT investigation, it's essential to define your scope. This includes identifying your target, the purpose of your investigation, and the information you are looking to gather. By doing this, you can focus your investigation and ensure that you are not wasting time on irrelevant information.

+ Step 2: Identify Your Target
Once you have defined your scope, the next step is to identify your target. In this case, we are using Reddit as our OSINT tool, so we need to identify the subreddits that are relevant to our investigation. For example, if we are investigating a company, we may want to look at the subreddits that are related to that industry or the company itself.

+ Step 3: Gather Information
The next step is to start gathering information. There are a few tools that you can use to do this:

Reddit Search - This is the most obvious tool that you can use to search for information on Reddit. You can use the search bar at the top of the page to search for keywords related to your investigation.

Reddit Investigator - Reddit Investigator is a third-party tool that you can use to analyze a user's activity on Reddit. You can enter a username, and it will give you information about the user's activity, such as the subreddits they are active in and their most commonly used words.

Reddit Enhancement Suite - Reddit Enhancement Suite is a browser extension that adds additional features to Reddit. One of these features is the ability to filter comments and posts by keywords, which can be helpful when looking for specific information.

+ Step 4: Analyze the Information
Once you have gathered information, the next step is to analyze it. Look for patterns or trends that can help you in your investigation. For example, if you are investigating a company, look for comments from employees or customers that may provide insights into the company's operations or culture.

+ Step 5: Report Your Findings
Finally, it's essential to report your findings. You can use tools like Maltego or Spiderfoot to create a visual representation of your findings, which can help you to identify relationships and connections between different pieces of information. You should also provide a detailed report of your findings, including any recommendations for further investigation.

## Conclusion
Reddit can be a valuable tool for OSINT purposes, but it's important to approach it with a clear plan and defined scope. By following these steps and using the right tools, you can gather valuable information that can help you to carry out a successful penetration test.
