# Image OSINT

Image OSINT, or open-source intelligence gathering using images, can be a valuable tool for penetration testers seeking to gather information about their targets. In this article, we will explore the tools and techniques used in performing image OSINT, step-by-step.

+ Step 1: Collecting Images
The first step in performing image OSINT is to collect images related to your target. This can include images of the target's website, social media profiles, advertisements, and any other publicly available images. The following tools can be used to collect images:

* Google Images
* Bing Images
* TinEye
* Yandex Images
* pimeyes

+ Step 2: Analyzing Metadata
Once you have collected the images, the next step is to analyze their metadata. Metadata is information embedded in the image file, such as the date and time the photo was taken, the location where the photo was taken, the camera used to take the photo, and the software used to edit the photo. This information can be invaluable in identifying the source of the image and the target's location. The following tools can be used to analyze metadata:

* ExifTool
* Metagoofil
* FOCA

+ Step 3: Identifying Geolocation
Geolocation is the process of identifying the physical location of a device or network. In image OSINT, geolocation can be used to identify the location where the photo was taken. The following tools can be used to identify geolocation:

* Google Maps
* GeoGuessr
* GeoImgr

+ Step 4: Identifying Social Media Profiles
Images posted on social media can provide valuable information about the target, including their interests, activities, and social network. The following tools can be used to identify social media profiles:

* Social Searcher
* Facebook Graph Search
* Twitter Advanced Search

+ Step 5: Identifying Similar Images
Identifying similar images can be helpful in identifying the source of the image or in finding other images related to the target. The following tools can be used to identify similar images:

* Google Images
* TinEye
* Yandex Images

+ Step 6: Identifying Text within Images
Text within images can be used to identify the source of the image, the target's location, and other relevant information. The following tools can be used to identify text within images:

* Google OCR
* Tesseract OCR
* Kraken OCR

+ Step 7: Analyzing Image Content
Analyzing the content of an image can provide valuable information about the target, including their interests, activities, and social network. The following tools can be used to analyze image content:

* Clarifai
* Google Vision
* Microsoft Azure Computer Vision


Performing image OSINT can be a valuable tool for penetration testers seeking to gather information about their targets. By following the steps outlined above and using the tools recommended, you can identify valuable information about your target that can be used to launch a successful attack.
