# Email OSINT

Email OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) is a technique used by penetration testers to gather information about an organization's email infrastructure. It involves the use of various tools and techniques to extract information from publicly available sources, such as social media, search engines, and email archives, to gain insight into an organization's email infrastructure.

Email OSINT is a crucial step in the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing, as it provides valuable information that can be used to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an organization's email security. In this article, we will discuss the basics of email OSINT, the tools used, and a step-by-step guide on how to conduct email OSINT as a penetration tester.

## What is Email OSINT?

Email OSINT is the process of gathering information about an organization's email infrastructure using publicly available sources. This information can include email addresses, usernames, email servers, email clients, email protocols, email security measures, and more.

Email OSINT can be used to identify vulnerabilities in an organization's email security, such as weak passwords, outdated software, misconfigured servers, and more. It can also be used to gather intelligence on an organization's email usage, such as the frequency of email communication, the types of emails sent and received, and the email communication patterns of employees.

## How to Do Email OSINT?

The process of conducting email OSINT involves several steps, including identifying the target organization, gathering information about the email infrastructure, analyzing the data, and reporting the findings. Below are the steps involved in conducting email OSINT.

+ Step 1: Identify the Target Organization

The first step in conducting email OSINT is to identify the target organization. This can be done by searching for the organization's name on search engines, social media platforms, and other publicly available sources. Once you have identified the organization, you can begin gathering information about its email infrastructure.

+ Step 2: Gather Information About the Email Infrastructure

The second step in conducting email OSINT is to gather information about the target organization's email infrastructure. This can be done by using various tools and techniques, such as:

Email Harvesting Tools: Email harvesting tools can be used to extract email addresses from websites, social media platforms, and other sources. Examples of email harvesting tools include theharvester, Hunter.io, and Maltego.

DNS Lookup: DNS lookup can be used to gather information about the target organization's email servers, such as their IP addresses, domains, and MX records. This information can be obtained using tools such as nslookup and dig.

Email Header Analysis: Email header analysis can be used to gather information about the target organization's email security measures, such as the type of email client used, the email protocols used, and the email encryption used. This information can be obtained using tools such as Email Header Analyzer and MX Toolbox.

Social Media Analysis: Social media analysis can be used to gather information about the target organization's email usage, such as the email communication patterns of employees and the types of emails sent and received. This information can be obtained by analyzing social media posts and messages.

+ Step 3: Analyze the Data

The third step in conducting email OSINT is to analyze the data obtained in the previous step. This involves identifying patterns, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses in the target organization's email infrastructure. This analysis should be done in the context of the organization's business objectives, security policies, and regulatory compliance requirements.

+ Step 4: Report the Findings

The final step in conducting email OSINT is to report the findings to the organization's management team. This report should include a summary of the vulnerabilities and weaknesses identified, as well as recommendations for improving the organization's email security.

## Tools Used in Email OSINT

theHarvester: A tool used for email harvesting that can extract email addresses, subdomains, hosts, and employee names from various sources such as search engines, LinkedIn, and PGP servers.

Maltego: A data visualization and analysis tool that can be used for social media analysis, email header analysis, and DNS lookup.

Email Header Analyzer: A web-based tool that analyzes email headers to provide information about the email sender, receiver, subject, and email client used.

MX Toolbox: A tool that can perform DNS lookup and email header analysis to provide information about email servers, including their IP addresses, domains, and MX records.

Hunter.io: A tool used for email harvesting that can extract email addresses and employee names from various sources such as LinkedIn and company websites.

Shodan: A search engine that can be used to identify email servers and devices connected to the internet.

OSINT Framework: A web-based tool that provides a collection of OSINT tools and resources, including email OSINT tools.
