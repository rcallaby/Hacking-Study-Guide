<strong> Hacking-Study-Guide </strong>

This is my hacking study guide. It is meant to be a general study guide for certifications such as eJPT, PNTP, and OSCP among others. If you have a suggestion or addition to these notes please let me know. You are free to use these notes to help you study for what ever test you wish.

Currently, this covers Windows Escalation, Linux Escalation, and Bug Bounty as part of an ethical test of security. All of these aspects are very important. In the future, I may add additional sections such as those that cover Wi-fi and what ever else may come up in the realm of cybersecurity.

I will be adding to this resource on a semi-regular basis.
