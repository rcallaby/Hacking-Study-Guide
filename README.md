# Hacking-Study-Guide

This is my hacking study guide. It is meant to be a general study guide for certifications such as eJPT, PNTP, and OSCP among others. If you have a suggestion or addition to these notes please let me know. You are free to use these notes to help you study for what ever test you wish.

Currently, this covers Windows Escalation, Linux Escalation, and Bug Bounty as part of an ethical test of security. All of these aspects are very important. In the future, I may add additional sections such as those that cover Wi-fi and what ever else may come up in the realm of cybersecurity.

I will be adding to this resource on a semi-regular basis.
## Compelling Reasons to Learn Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing

Ethical hacking and penetration testing are essential components of the modern digital landscape. The exponential growth of the internet and interconnected technologies has brought numerous benefits, but has also made it easier for malicious actors to steal personal and sensitive data. As a result, organizations and individuals must be proactive in ensuring the security of their systems and data. Studying ethical hacking and penetration testing can provide individuals with the skills to understand how hackers operate and how to detect, prevent and remediate vulnerabilities.

By learning ethical hacking techniques, individuals can gain hands-on experience in detecting and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems and networks. This knowledge can be used to improve the security of their own systems, as well as those of their clients. It is also possible to use these skills to start a career as an ethical hacker or penetration tester, providing valuable services to organizations in need of security assessments.

Penetration testing is a valuable tool for organizations to identify security weaknesses in their systems and networks. This information can be used to implement effective security measures, preventing cyber attacks and theft of sensitive data. Ethical hackers and penetration testers play a critical role in helping organizations stay secure, and organizations are willing to pay a premium for their services. As the demand for cyber security experts increases, so too does the demand for individuals with ethical hacking and penetration testing skills.

Moreover, ethical hacking and penetration testing require a unique combination of technical, analytical, and communication skills. Individuals who study these disciplines must be able to think like a hacker, understand complex technologies and systems, and effectively communicate their findings to others. These skills are highly transferable, and can be applied to a wide range of other fields, from software development to digital forensics.

Ethical hacking and penetration testing are essential disciplines for anyone interested in improving the security of their own systems, or helping organizations do so. These fields offer a wealth of opportunities for career growth, as well as personal and professional development. With the increasing threat of cyber attacks, the demand for skilled ethical hackers and penetration testers is only set to grow. So, if you're interested in cybersecurity, then studying ethical hacking and penetration testing is a great place to start.
