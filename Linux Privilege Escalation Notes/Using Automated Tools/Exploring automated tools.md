# Exploring automated tools

There are several automated tools that make gaining privilege escalation just a bit easier. While you shouldn't be dependent upon these tools for a penetration test you should be familar with using them and the type of output they may produce.

**LinPEAS**

The first of these tools is called LinPEAS which essentially helps you out in enumerating a Linux box and maybe will point you in the right direction. One of the benefits of this tool is that it doesn't have any dependencies so therefore it isn't dependent upon obscure libraries or tools that may be hard to find.

LinePEAS should be run first and then you should move on to other tools.

**LinEnum**

This is similar to LinPEAS but again it is just a shell script with no dependencies and therefore it can be quite easy to upload and use in a vunerable machine.

**Linux Exploit Suggester**

This tool just does what it says, it suggests exploits that may be on the machine based upon certain settings or other hints that it is looking for. This tool is fairly well maintained and the output should be very easy to interpret.
