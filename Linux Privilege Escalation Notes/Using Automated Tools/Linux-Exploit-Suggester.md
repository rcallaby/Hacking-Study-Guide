# Linux Exploit Suggester

Linux-Exploit-Suggester is a tool that is used to identify potential vulnerabilities in Linux systems. It is designed to scan a Linux system and provide suggestions for exploits that can be used to gain unauthorized access or control of the system. This tool can be used by security professionals to identify and fix vulnerabilities in a Linux system.

## What is Linux-Exploit-Suggester?

Linux-Exploit-Suggester is an open-source tool that is used to identify potential exploits that can be used to compromise a Linux system. It uses a database of known vulnerabilities and exploits to scan the system and provide suggestions for exploits that can be used to gain unauthorized access or control of the system.

## How does it work?

Linux-Exploit-Suggester works by scanning the system and analyzing the kernel and software versions installed on the system. It then compares the version information against a database of known vulnerabilities and exploits to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the system.

The tool also analyzes the system configuration and checks for misconfigurations that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access. It provides a detailed report of the vulnerabilities found on the system along with suggestions for exploits that can be used to exploit those vulnerabilities.

## Why should you use it?

Linux-Exploit-Suggester is a valuable tool for security professionals who are responsible for managing the security of Linux systems. It provides a quick and easy way to identify potential vulnerabilities in a system and provides suggestions for exploits that can be used to gain unauthorized access.

Using this tool can help security professionals identify and fix vulnerabilities before they are exploited by attackers. It can also be used as a tool for auditing the security of a Linux system to ensure that it is secure and up-to-date.

In conclusion, Linux-Exploit-Suggester is a valuable tool for identifying potential vulnerabilities in Linux systems. It provides suggestions for exploits that can be used to gain unauthorized access to the system and can be used by security professionals to ensure the security of Linux systems.

## Step by Step Guide on Using Linux-Exploit-Suggester

First, download the Linux-Exploit-Suggester tool from its GitHub repository: https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester.

Once you have downloaded the tool, navigate to the directory where you have saved it.

Before you can use the tool, you need to provide it with some basic information about the system you are targeting. To do this, run the following command:

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh --update

```
This will download the necessary database files that the tool uses to suggest possible exploits.

Next, you need to generate a report of the system's vulnerabilities. To do this, run the following command:

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh -k <kernel_version> -i <input_file>

```
Replace <kernel_version> with the version number of the Linux kernel you are targeting. You can find the version number by running the following command:

```
$ uname -r

```
Replace <input_file> with the name of the file containing the system's output. This file can be generated by running various commands, such as uname -a, cat /etc/issue, and lsb_release -a. You can redirect the output of these commands to a file by running a command like this:

```
$ uname -a > system_info.txt

```
Once you have provided the necessary information, the tool will generate a report of possible vulnerabilities and exploits. Review the report carefully and try any suggested exploits that are appropriate for your situation.

That's it! Using the Linux-Exploit-Suggester tool can be a helpful step in identifying potential vulnerabilities and exploits on a Linux system. However, it's important to note that this tool is not foolproof and should be used as part of a larger security strategy.
