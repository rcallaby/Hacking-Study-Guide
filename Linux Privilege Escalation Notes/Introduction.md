# Introduction

These are my personal notes that I will keep when studying for various certifications such as the OSCP, PNTP, among other Penetration Testing certifications.

Of course, this is a work in progress and it is far from complete but over time this should be a great resource for others in the future.

Please keep in mind that the OSCP, PNTP, and eJPT may be registered trademarks of their respective businesses. All effort is performed to respect these trademarks.
