# Kernel Exploits

What is a Kernel?

It is a computer program that controls everything in the system

It facilitates interactions between hardware and software components.

It is a translator

Be sure to reference the various Linux Kernel exploits on GitHub such as those found on lucyos/kernel-exploits

When you enemurate a Linux box you can tell which Kernel it is running by checking uname such as:

```
    uname -a
```

You can check the exploitdb for the various exploits based upon the kernel you are running such as the "dirty cow" exploit which runs on various versions of Kernels

Kernel exploits are very easy to identify through a Google method or through automated tools.
