## Step 1: Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
- You may also need Git if youâ€™re pulling the tool from a repository.

#### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/lunis.git
   cd lunis
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Lunis**:
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

### Step 2: Configuration

Lunis requires some configuration before it can be used effectively. This involves setting up configuration files and possibly environment variables.

1. **Create a Configuration File**:
   Lunis typically uses a YAML or JSON file for configuration. Here's an example configuration file (`config.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   logging:
     level: INFO
     file: logs/lunis.log

   network:
     interface: eth0
     timeout: 30

   threat_detection:
     enable: true
     rules: /path/to/rules
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables** (if needed):
   ```bash
   export LUNIS_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config.yaml
   export LUNIS_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

### Step 3: Running Lunis

Lunis can be run in different modes depending on your requirements.

#### Running in Network Monitoring Mode

1. **Start Lunis in Network Monitoring Mode**:
   ```bash
   lunis monitor --config /path/to/config.yaml
   ```

2. **Example Output**:
   ```
   [INFO] Starting network monitoring on interface eth0
   [INFO] Loaded 25 threat detection rules
   [INFO] Monitoring traffic...
   ```

#### Running a Specific Scan

1. **Run a Network Scan**:
   ```bash
   lunis scan --target 192.168.1.1 --config /path/to/config.yaml
   ```

2. **Example Output**:
   ```
   [INFO] Initiating scan on target 192.168.1.1
   [INFO] Scan results:
   [INFO] - Open Ports: 22, 80, 443
   [INFO] - Detected Threats: None
   ```

### Step 4: Analyzing Results

Once Lunis has completed its scans or monitoring, you need to analyze the results to take action.

1. **View Logs**:
   The logs can be found in the file specified in your configuration (`logs/lunis.log`).

   ```bash
   cat logs/lunis.log
   ```

2. **Example Log Entries**:
   ```
   2024-06-10 12:00:00,000 - INFO - Starting network monitoring on interface eth0
   2024-06-10 12:01:00,000 - INFO - Detected new device on network: 192.168.1.5
   2024-06-10 12:02:00,000 - WARNING - Potential threat detected: IP 192.168.1.5 trying to access port 22
   ```

### Step 5: Responding to Threats

When a threat is detected, you need to respond promptly.

1. **Manual Response**:
   - Isolate the device: Use network management tools to isolate the device.
   - Block IP addresses: Use firewall rules to block malicious IPs.

2. **Automated Response**:
   Configure Lunis to automatically respond to threats. Add the following to your configuration file:

   ```yaml
   threat_detection:
     enable: true
     rules: /path/to/rules
     response:
       action: isolate
       notify: admin@example.com
   ```

### Step 6: Updating Rules and Signatures

Keeping your threat detection rules and signatures up-to-date is crucial.

1. **Update Rules**:
   Download the latest rules from your provider or repository.

   ```bash
   wget https://example.com/latest-rules.tar.gz -O /path/to/rules/latest-rules.tar.gz
   tar -xzvf /path/to/rules/latest-rules.tar.gz -C /path/to/rules
   ```

2. **Restart Lunis** to apply the new rules:
   ```bash
   lunis restart --config /path/to/config.yaml
   ```

### Step 7: Advanced Usage and Scripting

Lunis can be extended with custom scripts and plugins.

1. **Create a Custom Script** (`custom_script.py`):
   ```python
   import lunis

   def custom_detection(packet):
       if packet.src == '192.168.1.5':
           lunis.alert('Suspicious activity detected from 192.168.1.5')

   lunis.add_detection_rule(custom_detection)
   ```

2. **Run Lunis with Custom Script**:
   ```bash
   lunis monitor --config /path/to/config.yaml --script /path/to/custom_script.py
   ```

### Example Use Cases

#### Example 1: Monitoring for Specific Traffic

- **Scenario**: You want to monitor for any SSH traffic on your network.
- **Configuration**:
  ```yaml
  network:
    interface: eth0
    filter: 'tcp port 22'
  ```

- **Run**:
  ```bash
  lunis monitor --config /path/to/config.yaml
  ```

#### Example 2: Automated Threat Response

- **Scenario**: Automatically block IP addresses attempting brute-force SSH attacks.
- **Configuration**:
  ```yaml
  threat_detection:
    enable: true
    rules: /path/to/rules
    response:
      action: block_ip
      notify: security_team@example.com
  ```

- **Run**:
  ```bash
  lunis monitor --config /path/to/config.yaml
  ```

### Conclusion

Lunis is a versatile tool for network security monitoring and threat detection. By following these steps, you can install, configure, and effectively use Lunis to secure your network. Regular updates and customization through scripting allow you to adapt to emerging threats and maintain robust network security.
