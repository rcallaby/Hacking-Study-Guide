# ADRecon

ADRecon is a popular tool used in the cybersecurity field for Active Directory (AD) reconnaissance. Its primary purpose is to gather detailed information about an Active Directory environment, which is the backbone of many organizational networks. Active Directory manages and stores information about network resources, such as users, computers, and policies, and facilitates their interaction. ADRecon allows cybersecurity professionals to collect and analyze this information comprehensively, enabling them to understand the structure, relationships, and configurations within the AD. This data is crucial for identifying potential security weaknesses, misconfigurations, or compliance issues that could be exploited by malicious actors.

The use of ADRecon is essential in conducting thorough security assessments. By providing a detailed overview of the AD environment, the tool helps security analysts pinpoint areas that may require attention or remediation. For example, it can reveal user accounts with excessive privileges, dormant accounts that could be exploited, or improperly configured group policies that may weaken security. Additionally, ADRecon’s output includes valuable insights into the relationships between different AD objects, such as trust relationships between domains, which are critical for understanding the overall security posture of the network. This level of detail ensures that security assessments are comprehensive and that any identified vulnerabilities can be addressed promptly and effectively.

Beyond security assessments, ADRecon is also invaluable for audits and compliance purposes. Many regulatory frameworks and industry standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, require organizations to maintain detailed records of their IT environments and to demonstrate that appropriate security measures are in place. ADRecon simplifies this process by automating the collection of AD data and presenting it in a structured format. Auditors can use the reports generated by ADRecon to verify that the organization’s AD configurations comply with relevant standards and best practices. This not only aids in achieving and maintaining compliance but also provides a clear record of the organization’s security posture, which can be used to demonstrate due diligence in protecting sensitive information.

### Step 1: Preparing Your Environment

1. **Install PowerShell**: Ensure that you have PowerShell installed on your system. ADRecon is a PowerShell script, so this is essential.

2. **Download ADRecon**: You can download the ADRecon script from its [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/adrecon/ADRecon).

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/adrecon/ADRecon.git
   ```

3. **Open PowerShell**: Launch PowerShell with administrative privileges.

### Step 2: Running ADRecon

1. **Navigate to the ADRecon Directory**:

   ```powershell
   cd path\to\ADRecon
   ```

2. **Unblock the Script**: If you downloaded the script from the internet, it might be blocked. Unblock it using the following command:

   ```powershell
   Unblock-File -Path .\ADRecon.ps1
   ```

3. **Execute the Script**: Run ADRecon with the required parameters.

   ```powershell
   .\ADRecon.ps1
   ```

### Step 3: Using Parameters

ADRecon has various parameters that you can use to customize your data collection.

- **-All**: Collects all available data.
- **-Users**: Collects information about users.
- **-Groups**: Collects information about groups.
- **-Computers**: Collects information about computers.
- **-Policies**: Collects information about policies.

**Example**: To collect all information:

```powershell
.\ADRecon.ps1 -All
```

**Example**: To collect only user information:

```powershell
.\ADRecon.ps1 -Users
```

### Step 4: Understanding the Output

1. **Output Directory**: By default, ADRecon saves its output in a directory named `ADRecon-Output` in the same directory where the script is located. 

2. **CSV Files**: The collected data is saved in CSV files. Each file corresponds to a different type of data (e.g., users, groups, computers).

3. **HTML Report**: ADRecon also generates an HTML report that provides a summary of the collected data.

### Step 5: Analyzing the Data

1. **CSV Files**: Open the CSV files using Excel or any other spreadsheet application. Each file will have columns representing different attributes of the objects.

2. **HTML Report**: Open the HTML report in a web browser. It provides a structured and visual representation of the data, making it easier to analyze.

### Step 6: Advanced Usage

1. **Targeting Specific Domains**: If you have multiple domains, you can target a specific domain using the `-Domain` parameter.

   ```powershell
   .\ADRecon.ps1 -Domain "example.com"
   ```

2. **Custom Output Directory**: Specify a custom output directory using the `-OutputPath` parameter.

   ```powershell
   .\ADRecon.ps1 -OutputPath "C:\Custom\Output\Directory"
   ```

3. **Credential Management**: If you need to run the script with different credentials, use the `-Credential` parameter.

   ```powershell
   $cred = Get-Credential
   .\ADRecon.ps1 -Credential $cred
   ```

### Step 7: Practical Example

Let’s go through a practical example where we collect all information from a domain and save it to a custom directory.

1. **Prepare the Environment**:

   ```powershell
   cd C:\Tools\ADRecon
   Unblock-File -Path .\ADRecon.ps1
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:

   ```powershell
   $cred = Get-Credential
   .\ADRecon.ps1 -All -Domain "example.com" -OutputPath "C:\ADReconReports" -Credential $cred
   ```

3. **Analyze the Output**:
   - Navigate to `C:\ADReconReports`.
   - Open the HTML report in your browser for a summary.
   - Open the CSV files in a spreadsheet application for detailed analysis.

### Step 8: Security Considerations

- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run ADRecon in the target AD environment.
- **Sensitive Data**: Be aware that the output contains sensitive information. Handle it with care and ensure it is stored securely.
- **Compliance**: Verify that using ADRecon complies with your organization's security policies and any applicable regulations.

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively use ADRecon for Active Directory reconnaissance in a cybersecurity context. The tool provides comprehensive data that can aid in understanding the AD environment, identifying potential security issues, and ensuring compliance with security policies.
