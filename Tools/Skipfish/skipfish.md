# Skipfish

### Step-by-Step Tutorial for Using Skipfish

#### Step 1: Installation

##### On Linux
1. **Update Package List:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
2. **Install Skipfish:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install skipfish
   ```

##### On macOS
1. **Install Homebrew (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. **Install Skipfish:**
   ```bash
   brew install skipfish
   ```

##### On Windows
Skipfish is natively designed for Unix-like environments. To run it on Windows, you can use a compatibility layer like Cygwin or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

1. **Using WSL:**
   - **Install WSL:**
     ```powershell
     wsl --install
     ```
   - **Install Skipfish in WSL:**
     Open WSL and follow the Linux installation steps.

#### Step 2: Basic Usage

1. **Create a Skipfish Dictionary:**
   Skipfish requires a dictionary file to operate. You can use the default dictionary included with Skipfish or customize your own.
   ```bash
   skipfish -W skipfish.wl
   ```

2. **Run Skipfish Scan:**
   Replace `target_website` with the URL of the site you want to scan.
   ```bash
   skipfish -o output_directory target_website
   ```

   - **-o**: Specifies the output directory for the report.
   - **target_website**: The URL of the target web application.

#### Step 3: Advanced Configuration

1. **Authentication:**
   If the web application requires authentication, you can use the `-A` option.
   ```bash
   skipfish -o output_directory -A user:password target_website
   ```

2. **Form Submission:**
   Skipfish can handle automatic form submissions. To specify form values, use the `-F` option.
   ```bash
   skipfish -o output_directory -F "username=admin&password=admin" target_website
   ```

3. **Custom Dictionary:**
   You can use a custom dictionary to tailor the scan to specific needs.
   ```bash
   skipfish -o output_directory -W custom_dictionary.wl target_website
   ```

4. **Limiting the Scan Scope:**
   Use the `-r` option to restrict the depth of the crawl.
   ```bash
   skipfish -o output_directory -r 2 target_website
   ```

5. **Excluding URLs:**
   To exclude certain URLs from the scan, use the `-X` option.
   ```bash
   skipfish -o output_directory -X /logout target_website
   ```

#### Step 4: Monitoring the Scan

1. **Real-time Monitoring:**
   Skipfish outputs real-time progress in the terminal. You can monitor the requests, errors, and current status directly.

2. **Pausing and Resuming:**
   You can pause the scan with `Ctrl + C` and resume it later using the same command.

#### Step 5: Analyzing the Results

1. **View the Report:**
   After the scan is complete, open the `index.html` file in the output directory with a web browser.
   ```bash
   cd output_directory
   firefox index.html
   ```

2. **Interpreting the Report:**
   The report includes various sections:
   - **Summary**: Provides an overview of the scan, including the number of requests made, errors encountered, and unique findings.
   - **Issue Types**: Lists different types of vulnerabilities detected.
   - **Site Structure**: Shows the crawled structure of the site.
   - **Vulnerability Details**: Detailed information about each finding, including severity, affected URL, and potential remediation steps.

#### Expert Tips and Considerations

1. **Legal and Ethical Considerations:**
   Always obtain explicit permission before scanning any web application to avoid legal issues. Unauthorized scanning can be considered illegal and unethical.

2. **Performance Tuning:**
   Adjust the scanning speed and concurrency settings to balance thoroughness and server load. High-intensity scans can disrupt the target server.

   - **Throttle Requests:**
     ```bash
     skipfish -o output_directory -S 10 target_website
     ```

   - **Concurrency:**
     ```bash
     skipfish -o output_directory -t 5 target_website
     ```

3. **Handling False Positives:**
   Be aware that automated tools like Skipfish can generate false positives. Always verify the findings manually before taking action.

4. **Integration with Other Tools:**
   Combine Skipfish with other tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for comprehensive security assessments.

5. **Regular Updates:**
   Keep Skipfish and its dictionaries updated to ensure it can detect the latest vulnerabilities.

6. **Environment Setup:**
   Perform scans in a controlled environment (e.g., staging servers) to avoid impacting production systems.

By following this tutorial, you should be able to effectively use Skipfish to conduct web application security scans, understand the results, and take appropriate actions to secure your web applications.
