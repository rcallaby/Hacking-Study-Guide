# Chisel - A port forwarding tool 

# Introduction:
In the realm of ethical hacking, port forwarding is a crucial technique that enables penetration testers and security professionals to access remote systems and services. Chisel, a versatile and powerful tool, has gained popularity for its efficient port forwarding capabilities. This article explores the features, applications, and advantages of Chisel, emphasizing its significance in ethical hacking.

## Understanding Port Forwarding:
Port forwarding allows network traffic to be redirected from one port on a system to another, enabling communication between different devices or networks. It plays a vital role in ethical hacking as it enables penetration testers to establish connections to remote systems and services. By forwarding ports, ethical hackers gain access to restricted resources, which aids in vulnerability identification and network analysis.

## Introducing Chisel:
Chisel is an open-source, cross-platform tool developed in Go (Golang) that facilitates secure TCP and UDP tunneling, acting as a versatile port forwarding solution. It provides a lightweight alternative to more complex tools like SSH tunnels and VPNs. Chisel operates by establishing a client-server architecture, allowing secure communication between the two endpoints.

## Features of Chisel:
Chisel offers several notable features that make it an attractive choice for ethical hackers:

* a. Encrypted Tunnels: Chisel encrypts the traffic passing through the tunnels, ensuring confidentiality and protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.

* b. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Chisel supports major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

* c. TCP and UDP Support: Chisel supports both TCP and UDP protocols, enabling port forwarding for a variety of services and applications.

* d. Minimal Configuration: Chisel's configuration is straightforward, allowing users to quickly set up and establish secure tunnels.

* e. Port Forwarding Flexibility: Chisel enables users to forward specific ports or ranges, facilitating access to services running on remote systems.

* f. Reverse Tunneling: Chisel supports reverse tunnels, allowing users to bypass firewalls and connect to systems behind network barriers.

## Chisel in Ethical Hacking:
Chisel finds extensive application in ethical hacking scenarios, including:

* a. Remote Exploitation: Ethical hackers can use Chisel to establish secure tunnels to remote systems, enabling them to conduct vulnerability assessments and exploit potential weaknesses.

* b. System Access: Chisel's port forwarding capabilities enable penetration testers to gain remote access to systems and services, facilitating deeper analysis and testing.

* c. Network Mapping: By forwarding specific ports, Chisel helps ethical hackers map networks and identify open services, assisting in vulnerability identification.

* d. Evasion Techniques: Chisel's encrypted tunnels aid in bypassing network security mechanisms, allowing ethical hackers to evade intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls.

* e. Red Teaming: Chisel can be integrated into red teaming engagements to simulate real-world attack scenarios, helping organizations test their security defenses.

## Advantages of Chisel:
Chisel offers several advantages that contribute to its effectiveness as a port forwarding tool for ethical hacking:

* a. Lightweight and Efficient: Chisel's small footprint and efficient design make it an excellent choice for resource-constrained environments.

* b. Security and Encryption: Chisel ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted through its encrypted tunnels, minimizing the risk of interception.

* c. Easy Setup and Configuration: Chisel's user-friendly configuration allows for quick deployment, reducing the complexity associated with other port forwarding tools.

* d. Versatile Functionality: Chisel's support for both TCP and UDP protocols, as well as its ability to forward specific ports or ranges, offers flexibility for diverse ethical hacking scenarios.

### Usage Tutorial

Certainly! Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. It's often used for penetration testing and secure communication between systems. I'll guide you through the process of using Chisel on both Windows and Linux.

### Prerequisites
1. **Chisel Binary**: Download the appropriate Chisel binary for your operating system from the [Chisel GitHub releases page](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases).
2. **SSH Access**: Ensure you have SSH access to the remote server if you are using Chisel for SSH tunneling.

### Installation

#### Windows
1. Download the Chisel binary (`chisel.exe`).
2. Place it in a directory included in your system's `PATH` or in any directory where you can easily access it.

#### Linux
1. Download the Chisel binary for Linux.
2. Make the binary executable:
    ```sh
    chmod +x chisel
    ```
3. Move it to a directory in your `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`:
    ```sh
    sudo mv chisel /usr/local/bin
    ```

### Basic Usage

Chisel operates in two modes: server and client. The server is set up on a machine that will receive the tunneled connections, while the client initiates the tunnel.

#### Setting up the Server

##### Windows
Run the Chisel server on your desired port. For example, to run it on port 8080:
```powershell
chisel.exe server -p 8080 --reverse
```

##### Linux
The same command can be used on Linux:
```sh
chisel server -p 8080 --reverse
```

The `--reverse` flag allows reverse port forwarding, enabling clients to expose their local services.

#### Setting up the Client

##### Windows
Suppose you want to forward local port 8000 to a remote port 80 through the server:
```powershell
chisel.exe client <server_ip>:8080 R:8000:localhost:80
```

##### Linux
On Linux, the command is the same:
```sh
chisel client <server_ip>:8080 R:8000:localhost:80
```

Here:
- `<server_ip>`: Replace with the IP address of the server.
- `R:8000:localhost:80`: This specifies reverse port forwarding where `8000` on the client will forward to `80` on the client.

### Advanced Usage

#### Forwarding a Remote Service to the Local Machine

Suppose you have a service running on port 22 (SSH) on the client and want to access it from the server.

1. **Server Command**:
   ```sh
   chisel server -p 8080 --reverse
   ```

2. **Client Command**:
   ```sh
   chisel client <server_ip>:8080 R:2222:localhost:22
   ```

Now, on the server, you can access the clientâ€™s SSH service on port 2222:
```sh
ssh -p 2222 user@localhost
```

#### Forwarding a Local Service to a Remote Machine

If you want to forward a local service (e.g., a web server on port 80) to a remote machine:

1. **Server Command** (if the server should forward the service):
   ```sh
   chisel server -p 8080
   ```

2. **Client Command**:
   ```sh
   chisel client <server_ip>:8080 80:localhost:80
   ```

This will forward the local port 80 to the server's port 80.

#### UDP Tunneling

Chisel also supports UDP tunneling. For example, to tunnel a UDP service:

1. **Server Command**:
   ```sh
   chisel server -p 8080 --udp
   ```

2. **Client Command**:
   ```sh
   chisel client <server_ip>:8080 R:5000:localhost:5000/udp
   ```

This forwards UDP packets from port 5000 on the client to port 5000 on the server.

### Securing Chisel

Chisel traffic is encrypted using SSH. To enhance security, you can:
1. Use SSH keys instead of passwords.
2. Restrict access using firewall rules.
3. Regularly update Chisel to patch any vulnerabilities.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Forwarding a Local Web Server to a Remote Server

**Server**:
```sh
chisel server -p 8080 --reverse
```

**Client**:
```sh
chisel client <server_ip>:8080 R:8000:localhost:80
```

Access the web server on the client from the server at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Example 2: Accessing a Remote Database Locally

**Server**:
```sh
chisel server -p 8080
```

**Client**:
```sh
chisel client <server_ip>:8080 3306:localhost:3306
```

Connect to the remote MySQL database running on port 3306 as if it were local.

### Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Refused**: Ensure the server is running and accessible.
2. **Port Conflicts**: Ensure the ports you are using are not in use by other services.
3. **Firewall Rules**: Check that your firewall allows traffic on the specified ports.

Chisel is a powerful tool for secure tunneling, suitable for both Windows and Linux. By setting up Chisel servers and clients, you can forward ports and access services across networks securely. Always ensure you understand the security implications and maintain best practices when using tunneling tools.
