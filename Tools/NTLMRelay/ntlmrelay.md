# NTLMRelay

NTLM Relay attacks are a form of cybersecurity exploitation where an attacker intercepts and relays NTLM authentication messages to access and potentially gain unauthorized privileges within a network. These attacks exploit the NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication protocol used by Windows. Below is a step-by-step guide on how this type of attack can be performed using tools like `ntlmrelayx`, a part of the Impacket suite. This guide assumes you have a foundational understanding of network protocols and cybersecurity principles.

As a CISO at a cybersecurity firm specializing in penetration testing for large corporations, understanding and utilizing tools like NTLMRelay is critical in our arsenal to assess the robustness of our clients’ security frameworks. NTLMRelay allows us to simulate advanced attack scenarios that target the NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication protocol, a common but vulnerable component in many corporate networks. By demonstrating how attackers can intercept and relay NTLM authentication sessions to gain unauthorized access, we provide a real-world assessment of potential security loopholes in our client's infrastructures. This practical demonstration helps us in not only identifying vulnerabilities but also in convincing client stakeholders of the urgent need for protocol upgrades, enhanced security measures, and the discontinuation of outdated practices such as the reliance on NTLM.

From a strategic viewpoint, employing NTLMRelay during engagements reinforces our commitment to thoroughness and excellence in security assessments. It is imperative that our team adheres to the highest ethical standards, conducting these tests under strictly controlled conditions with full client authorization to avoid any legal implications. We also use the insights gained from these tests to guide clients towards adopting more secure authentication mechanisms like Kerberos, implementing network segmentation, and enforcing SMB signing. These recommendations are tailored to fortify their defenses against not only NTLM relay attacks but also a broader spectrum of potential security threats. This proactive approach not only protects our clients but also enhances our firm's reputation as a leader in cutting-edge cybersecurity defense.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
1. **Install Impacket**: Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. `ntlmrelayx` is part of this suite. You can install it from its GitHub repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git
   cd impacket
   pip install .
   ```

2. **Network Setup**: Ensure that your testing environment does not interfere with live production environments. This type of activity should be performed in a controlled, authorized, and legal setting, such as a penetration testing lab.

### Step 2: Configure ntlmrelayx
1. **Basic Usage**: To start an NTLM relay attack, you use the `ntlmrelayx.py` script. A basic command to relay credentials to a target system looks like this:
   ```
   ntlmrelayx.py -t smb://TARGET_IP
   ```
   Replace `TARGET_IP` with the IP address of the target machine you have permission to test.

2. **Adding Features**: You can use various options to enhance the attack:
   - `-smb2support`: Enable SMB2 support.
   - `-socks`: Start a SOCKS proxy for relaying the traffic after authentication.
   - `-rpc-mode`: Relay the NTLM authentication to an RPC endpoint.

### Step 3: Execute the Attack
1. **Running the Attack**: With the target and configurations set, run the `ntlmrelayx.py` command. The script will wait for incoming NTLM authentication requests to relay.

2. **Capture and Relay**: On a separate terminal or via another attack vector, you need to induce or capture an NTLM authentication request. This can be done through methods like SMB requests, web traffic interception, or phishing emails that force authentication.

### Step 4: Post-Exploitation
1. **Accessing the Relay**: If the relay is successful and the target system is vulnerable, you might gain access to the system. Post-exploitation steps could include accessing sensitive files, executing commands, or elevating privileges.

2. **Using SOCKS Proxy**: If you started a SOCKS proxy, you could use it to route traffic through the compromised system, masking your actions under the victim’s identity.

### Precautions and Ethics
1. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Performing NTLM relay attacks without explicit, authorized permission is illegal and unethical. Always have written permission before testing systems that you do not own.

2. **Securing Systems**: To protect against NTLM relay attacks:
   - Ensure SMB signing is enabled and required on all systems.
   - Disable NTLM authentication where possible and use more secure alternatives like Kerberos.
   - Implement network segmentation and strict firewall rules to limit traffic that can carry NTLM authentication messages.

3. **Stay Updated**: Keep systems patched and follow best practices for network security to protect against new vulnerabilities and attack techniques.

This tutorial covers the basic approach to setting up and executing an NTLM relay attack for educational and ethical testing purposes. Always ensure your actions are legal, ethical, and authorized to avoid legal repercussions and ethical conflicts.
