# macOS Administration Questions

## User Management:

#### **1. How do you manage users and groups on macOS using the command line?**

On macOS, user and group management can be done using the **`dscl`** (Directory Service Command Line) tool. Here’s how you can perform some common tasks:

1. **Listing Users and Groups:**
   - To list all users:
     ```bash
     dscl . -list /Users
     ```
   - To list all groups:
     ```bash
     dscl . -list /Groups
     ```

2. **Adding a New User:**
   - Create a new user:
     ```bash
     sudo dscl . -create /Users/<username>
     ```
   - Set the user's full name:
     ```bash
     sudo dscl . -create /Users/<username> RealName "John Doe"
     ```
   - Set the user’s password:
     ```bash
     sudo dscl . -passwd /Users/<username> <password>
     ```
   - Set the user’s primary group ID (usually 20 for standard users or 80 for administrators):
     ```bash
     sudo dscl . -create /Users/<username> PrimaryGroupID 20
     ```
   - Assign a unique User ID (UID):
     ```bash
     sudo dscl . -create /Users/<username> UniqueID 501
     ```
   - Set the home directory:
     ```bash
     sudo dscl . -create /Users/<username> NFSHomeDirectory /Users/<username>
     ```

3. **Deleting a User:**
   ```bash
   sudo dscl . -delete /Users/<username>
   ```

4. **Managing Groups:**
   - Add a group:
     ```bash
     sudo dscl . -create /Groups/<groupname>
     ```
   - Add a user to a group:
     ```bash
     sudo dscl . -append /Groups/<groupname> GroupMembership <username>
     ```

These commands require administrative privileges, so `sudo` is often necessary. Additionally, macOS System Preferences or the **`sysadminctl`** tool can also be used for similar tasks.

#### **2. What is the difference between a standard user and an administrator on macOS?**

**Standard User:**
- A standard user has limited privileges and can perform typical day-to-day operations, such as running applications, saving files, and customizing their user account settings.
- **Cannot** make system-wide changes, such as installing software for all users, adding/removing users, or changing system settings like security preferences.
- Primarily used for non-technical users or for security purposes to minimize the risk of system damage or malware.

**Administrator:**
- An administrator has elevated privileges, allowing them to manage system-wide settings and configurations.
- **Can perform tasks such as:**
  - Adding or removing users.
  - Installing software for all users.
  - Configuring system preferences that apply to all users (e.g., firewall, sharing, security settings).
- Administrator accounts are often the first user created during macOS setup and should be used sparingly for security reasons.

**Key Difference:**
- The main difference lies in the level of access to system-wide settings and operations. Administrators can modify the system and other users, whereas standard users are confined to their own accounts.

#### **3. How do you enumerate users and their privileges during a penetration test on macOS?**

During a penetration test, user enumeration on macOS can be done through both local and remote means:

1. **Using `dscl`:**
   - List all users:
     ```bash
     dscl . -list /Users
     ```
   - Check if a user is an admin:
     ```bash
     groups <username>
     ```
     Look for "admin" in the output.

2. **Checking the `/etc/passwd` File:**
   - The file contains a list of all users, though it may not reveal passwords (since macOS uses shadow files):
     ```bash
     cat /etc/passwd
     ```

3. **Check Sudoers File:**
   - Identify users with sudo privileges:
     ```bash
     cat /etc/sudoers
     ```
   - Alternatively, check the `/var/db/sudo` directory for sudo logs.

4. **Remote Enumeration via SSH:**
   - Attempt SSH brute-forcing or credential stuffing to identify valid accounts.

**Defense:** Secure the system by minimizing user accounts with admin privileges, auditing the `/etc/sudoers` file, and disabling SSH for unnecessary users.

#### **4. How can you escalate privileges on macOS?**

Privilege escalation can be attempted through:
1. **Exploiting Misconfigured Sudoers:**
   - If `NOPASSWD` is set for certain commands, escalate privileges by running those commands without a password:
     ```bash
     sudo <command>
     ```

2. **Abusing World-Writable Files or Directories:**
   - Check for misconfigured permissions:
     ```bash
     find / -perm -2 -type f 2>/dev/null
     ```
   - Replace or modify writable files to gain higher privileges.

3. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:**
   - Search for macOS-specific exploits, such as privilege escalation flaws in older versions.

4. **Leveraging GUI Applications:**
   - Forensic software like keyloggers may reveal admin credentials if the target is actively using the system.

#### **5. How would you secure user accounts on macOS?**

To secure macOS user accounts:
1. **Disable Guest Accounts:**
   - System Preferences → Users & Groups → Guest User → Uncheck "Allow guests to log in to this computer."

2. **Enforce Strong Passwords:**
   - Use `pwpolicy` to configure password policies:
     ```bash
     sudo pwpolicy -setglobalpolicy "minChars=12 requiresAlpha=1 requiresNumeric=1"
     ```

3. **Limit Admin Access:**
   - Reduce the number of administrator accounts. Use standard accounts for daily operations.

4. **Enable FileVault:**
   - Protect user data by enabling full-disk encryption:
     ```bash
     sudo fdesetup enable
     ```

5. **Audit User Privileges:**
   - Regularly review user permissions and disable unused accounts.

6. **Configure Login Options:**
   - Require passwords immediately after sleep or screensaver starts.
