### Can you explain a time when you had to learn a new tool or technology quickly to complete a task?

**"In one engagement, I had to perform a red team assessment that required bypassing advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. The client had recently upgraded their security stack, and my usual toolset was getting flagged. I quickly identified that I needed to learn a new framework—Covenant, a .NET-based C2 framework—to execute evasive post-exploitation techniques without being detected.  

Since time was critical, I focused on three key areas:  
1. **Rapid Familiarization** – I read through the Covenant documentation and community discussions to understand its capabilities, especially in-memory execution and encrypted C2 communications.  
2. **Lab Testing** – I set up a local test environment with a Windows 10 VM running the same EDR as the client to test payload execution and obfuscation techniques.  
3. **Operational Adaptation** – I customized Covenant’s launchers and sharpened my use of `Donut` to generate shellcode that evaded static signature detection. I also leveraged `SharpSploit` to perform lateral movement while keeping a low detection footprint.  

Within a few hours, I successfully deployed a foothold on the client’s machine, evaded EDR, and executed the required post-exploitation tasks. This experience reinforced my ability to adapt quickly, learn new tools under pressure, and apply offensive security knowledge dynamically in real-world assessments."**  

Why this response is effective and things you should consider:  
- **Problem-solving skills** (adapting to a new security control)  
- **Technical expertise** (learning and applying Covenant, Donut, and SharpSploit)  
- **A structured approach** (familiarization, testing, and execution)  
- **Impact** (how the quick learning led to successful task completion) 

Now, this is just an example of what you could say during a interview, the important part is to focus on what can you truthfully demonstrate. Get an answer prepared for this type of question that shows your problem solving skills.

### **Final Tip for Answering This in an Interview**  
Don't just list resources you use but make it more personable by doing some of the following:  
✅ **What you actually use day-to-day**  
✅ **A recent vulnerability/tool you learned about and applied**  
✅ **How you validate or test new techniques in a safe environment**  

Of course, these are just suggestions to the question, you will want to pull from your own experiences. If you have actually created a lab or box then this would be another way to stay up to date with new vulnerabilities.

### Describe a challenging engagement where you didn’t achieve the expected outcome. How did you handle it?

During a **web application penetration test**, I was tasked with identifying vulnerabilities in a client’s e-commerce platform. The expected outcome was to demonstrate at least **one critical exploit**, such as SQL injection or remote code execution. However, the application had a robust **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** that blocked most automated scanning and even some manual payloads. Additionally, our assessment was **black-box**, meaning we had no access to source code or backend configurations, making it harder to identify vulnerabilities.  

### **How I Handled It:**  
1. **Pivoted Techniques:** Instead of relying on automated scanners, I switched to **manual testing**, focusing on bypass techniques for the WAF, such as encoding payloads, case manipulation, and leveraging lesser-known HTTP methods.  
2. **Examined Misconfigurations:** Since direct exploitation was blocked, I shifted my approach to **business logic flaws** and **access control weaknesses**, which are often overlooked by automated tools.  
3. **Communicated Challenges Early:** Rather than waiting until the final report, I kept the client informed about the WAF’s effectiveness and suggested **alternative testing strategies**, such as a **gray-box** approach (limited access to backend details).  
4. **Post-Engagement Learning:** After the engagement, I spent time **researching new WAF evasion techniques** and added them to my personal methodology to be better prepared for similar scenarios in the future.  

### **Advice to a Junior Penetration Tester:**  
- **Don’t rely solely on automated tools.** Manual testing is essential when security defenses block standard techniques.  
- **Understand defensive mechanisms.** Learning how WAFs, EDRs, and other security tools work will help you develop better evasion strategies.  
- **Communicate proactively.** If a test isn’t going as expected, update stakeholders and suggest workarounds.  
- **Always keep learning.** The best testers are those who take every challenge as an opportunity to refine their skills and methodologies.  

Even when an engagement doesn’t produce the expected results, the ability to **adapt, document findings, and learn from the experience** is what defines a strong penetration tester.

Now, the above is just an example of what you could say. Of course, you will want to use your own experience. The idea of this question and example answer is for you to use this as a template to form your own answer.

### How do you manage your workflow during a penetration test to ensure all agreed-upon objectives are met within the allotted time?

### What documentation practices do you follow while performing an assessment, and how do you ensure accuracy in your notes?

### How do you prepare before starting a penetration test to ensure all prerequisites are met, such as tools, permissions, and scope clarity?

### Can you describe how you would verify and organize your findings before submitting them for review?

### What steps do you take to ensure that your testing approach aligns with the agreed-upon rules of engagement?

### Describe your method for organizing evidence (e.g., screenshots, logs) collected during an assessment for inclusion in a report.

### How do you handle situations where you encounter gaps in your knowledge or tools during an engagement?

### How would you prepare for a penetration test in an environment where the client uses legacy systems that lack documentation?

### What techniques do you use to stay organized when juggling technical tasks, learning new tools, and responding to team feedback?



## Tools and Practical Knowledge

### What are your top three penetration testing tools, and why?

### Describe a scenario where you used Burp Suite to identify vulnerabilities in a web application.
**Scenario:**  
During a personal lab setup, I tested a deliberately vulnerable web application using Burp Suite to identify security weaknesses. My goal was to practice common web application vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).  

**Approach:**  
1. **Intercepting Requests:** I configured Burp Suite as a proxy and intercepted HTTP requests between my browser and the web application.  
2. **Analyzing Parameters:** While browsing the site, I noticed a login form and used Burp Suite’s **Proxy** and **Repeater** to analyze how the application processed user input.  
3. **Testing for SQL Injection:** By modifying the login parameters with SQL payloads (e.g., `admin' OR '1'='1`), I observed different responses, indicating a possible SQL injection vulnerability.  
4. **Automating the Attack:** I then used Burp Suite’s **Intruder** to automate payload testing, confirming that injecting malicious SQL statements could bypass authentication.  
5. **Validating XSS:** Switching focus to input fields, I tested for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` into form fields. The payload executed in the browser, confirming improper input sanitization.  

**Findings and Mitigation Recommendations:**  
After identifying these vulnerabilities, I documented my findings, including request/response details and remediation steps such as implementing prepared statements for SQL queries and proper input validation/sanitization to prevent XSS.  

**Outcome:**  
This hands-on experience reinforced my understanding of web application vulnerabilities and how to use Burp Suite effectively for real-world penetration testing scenarios.  
Now of course, you will need to modify the answer a bit to make it a bit more personable and realistic to your actual experiences if you have any experience what so ever.

### What is the difference between active and passive reconnaissance? Provide examples of tools you would use for both.

Reconnaissance is the initial phase of a penetration test where information about the target is gathered. It can be categorized into **active** and **passive** reconnaissance:  

1. **Passive Reconnaissance** – Involves gathering information about the target without directly interacting with it. The goal is to avoid detection while collecting data from publicly available sources.  
   - **Example:** Searching for subdomains using **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) tools** or analyzing metadata from documents found online.  
   - **Tools Used:**  
     - **Shodan** – Scans the internet for exposed services and devices.  
     - **theHarvester** – Gathers emails, subdomains, and other information from public sources.  
     - **Google Dorking** – Uses advanced Google search queries to find sensitive data.  
     - **WHOIS Lookup** – Retrieves domain registration details.  

2. **Active Reconnaissance** – Involves directly interacting with the target system to gather information. This method is more intrusive and may trigger security alerts.  
   - **Example:** Scanning a web server for open ports and services using **network scanning tools**.  
   - **Tools Used:**  
     - **Nmap** – Performs port scanning, service enumeration, and OS detection.  
     - **Burp Suite** – Intercepts and manipulates web requests for testing vulnerabilities.  
     - **Nikto** – Scans web servers for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.  
     - **Gobuster/Dirb** – Performs directory and file brute-force enumeration on web servers.  

### Conclusion
Passive reconnaissance is stealthier and used for initial information gathering, while active reconnaissance is more direct but riskier as it may alert the target. A skilled penetration tester balances both techniques to efficiently map the attack surface before proceeding with exploitation.  

### How do you identify and bypass WAF (Web Application Firewall) protections?

For a **junior** role, this question evaluates your understanding of **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)** and your ability to **identify and bypass** them during an engagement. Here’s how to structure your answer:

---

### **1. Identifying WAF Protections**
*"During a web application assessment, I first determine whether a WAF is present before attempting any bypass techniques. I use a combination of manual testing and automated tools to identify WAF protections."*

#### **Methods to Detect WAFs**
- **Fingerprinting WAF Using Online Tools**
  - `wafw00f` – A tool that detects WAFs based on their responses.
    ```bash
    wafw00f https://target.com
    ```
  - `WhatWaf` – Another WAF detection tool that identifies WAF providers.
- **Analyzing HTTP Responses**
  - Look for WAF-related headers (e.g., `X-Sucuri-ID`, `X-CDN`, `Server: cloudflare`).
  - Send intentionally malformed requests (e.g., `GET /` with a long payload) and analyze status codes like **403 Forbidden, 406 Not Acceptable, or 503 Service Unavailable**.
- **Behavioral Testing**
  - Test **basic SQL injection** or **XSS payloads** to check if responses are blocked or sanitized.

---

### **2. Bypassing WAF Protections**
*"Once I confirm a WAF is in place, I try various bypass techniques depending on how it filters or inspects requests."*

#### **Bypass Techniques**
1. **Encoding Payloads**  
   - **URL Encoding**: `SELECT * FROM users` → `%53%45%4C%45%43%54%20%2A%20%46%52%4F%4D%20%75%73%65%72%73`
   - **Base64 Encoding**: `SELECT * FROM users` → `U0VMRUNUICogRlJPTSB1c2Vycw==`
   - **Hex Encoding**: `SELECT * FROM users` → `0x53656C656374202A2046726F6D207573657273`
   
2. **Case Manipulation & Comment Injection (SQLi Bypass)**
   - `"UNION SELECT 1,2,3"` → `"uNioN sElEcT 1,2,3"`
   - `"SELECT/*foo*/1,2 FROM/*bar*/users"`

3. **Using Alternate HTTP Methods**
   - If `GET` requests are blocked, try `POST`, `HEAD`, or `TRACE`.

4. **Parameter Pollution**
   - Instead of `?id=1`, use `?id=1&id=2` or `?id=1%26id=2` to confuse filtering mechanisms.

5. **Using Trusted Hosts & Headers**
   - Some WAFs allow bypassing when requests come from trusted sources.
   - Modify `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Originating-IP`, or `X-Real-IP` headers.

   ```http
   GET /admin HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
   ```

---

### **3. Example of a Custom WAF Bypass Script**
*"During an engagement, I created a Python script to automate WAF bypass attempts by applying encoding techniques and modifying request headers."*

```python
import requests
import base64

target_url = "https://target.com/vuln_page.php?id="

# Example payload (SQL Injection)
payload = "' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 -- "

# Encode payloads
encoded_payloads = {
    "Base64": base64.b64encode(payload.encode()).decode(),
    "URL": requests.utils.quote(payload),
    "Hex": ''.join(hex(ord(c))[2:] for c in payload)
}

# Attempt requests with different encodings
for encoding, encoded_payload in encoded_payloads.items():
    full_url = f"{target_url}{encoded_payload}"
    response = requests.get(full_url, headers={"X-Forwarded-For": "127.0.0.1"})
    
    print(f"Trying {encoding} encoding: {full_url}")
    print(f"Response Code: {response.status_code}")
```

**Purpose:**  
- Tests multiple encoding techniques to see which payloads bypass WAF filtering.  
- Uses `X-Forwarded-For` header spoofing to bypass IP-based filtering.

### **Why This Answer Works**
**Demonstrates WAF Detection Skills** – Uses tools like `wafw00f` and HTTP analysis.  
**Explains Bypass Techniques Clearly** – Covers encoding, HTTP method switching, and parameter pollution.  
**Shows Practical Knowledge** – Provides a real-world custom script example.  

### What scripting languages do you use during engagements, and can you provide an example of a custom script you created?

For a **junior** role, interviewers ask this question to assess your familiarity with scripting languages used during penetration testing and your ability to create or modify scripts to automate tasks. Here’s how you can structure your answer with real-world examples:

---

### **1. Scripting Languages Commonly Used in Penetration Testing**
*"During engagements, I primarily use scripting languages such as Python, Bash, and PowerShell, depending on the environment and the task at hand."*  

- **Python**: Used for automation, exploit development, and interacting with security tools like `Impacket`, `Scapy`, and `pwntools`.  
- **Bash**: Useful for quick enumeration, process automation, and remote command execution on Linux systems.  
- **PowerShell**: Essential for Windows enumeration, privilege escalation, and interacting with Active Directory.  

---

### **2. Example of a Custom Script You Created**
*"One example of a custom script I created was a Python-based SMB enumeration tool to automate the discovery of shared resources on a network."*  

#### **Custom Python Script Example: SMB Share Enumeration**
*(Used during internal penetration tests to identify accessible SMB shares)*  
```python
import smbclient

smbclient.ClientConfig(username="guest", password="")

def enumerate_shares(target_ip):
    try:
        shares = smbclient.list_shares(target_ip)
        for share in shares:
            print(f"[+] Found share: {share}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[-] Error: {e}")

target = "192.168.1.10"
enumerate_shares(target)
```
**Purpose:**  
- Enumerates SMB shares without authentication.  
- Helps identify misconfigured or publicly accessible shares.  

---

### **Alternative Example: PowerShell Script for Windows Enumeration**
*(If the company focuses on Windows environments, a PowerShell script might be a better example.)*  
```powershell
$computers = Get-Content computers.txt
foreach ($computer in $computers) {
    Write-Host "Enumerating shares on $computer"
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computer -ScriptBlock {
        Get-SmbShare | Select-Object Name, Path, Description
    }
}
```
**Purpose:**  
- Reads a list of computers and queries available SMB shares.  
- Automates enumeration across multiple systems in an Active Directory environment.  

---

### **Why This Answer Works**
**Shows Practical Knowledge** – Uses real-world tools and languages.  
**Demonstrates Customization** – Shows the ability to create scripts based on engagement needs.  
**Highlights Adaptability** – Covers Linux (Python/Bash) and Windows (PowerShell).  

#### Future considerations
This is just a few examples and you will need to provide your own examples, ideally if you have some scripts in a github repository then that is even better. Of course, if you have some CVE's then you will have some scripts or bits of code. The more CVE's that you can find the more likely you will be able to get considered for a future job.
