Below is a listing of all the known, at least to me, Active Directory boxes on Hack the Box.

* Active
* Reel
* Sauna
* Monteverde
* Sizzle
* Multimaster
* Forest
* APT
* Resolute

As well, the Pro Labs and Endgame of the HackTheBox cover Active Directory excercises and boxes that will help you practice Active Directory penetration testing.
