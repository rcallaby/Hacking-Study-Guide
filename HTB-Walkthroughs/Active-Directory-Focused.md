Below is a listing of all the known, at least to me, Active Directory boxes on Hack the Box.

- Active
- Reel
- Sauna
- Monteverde
- Sizzle
- Multimaster
- Forest
- APT
- Resolute
- Remote

As well, the Pro Labs and Endgame of the HackTheBox cover Active Directory excercises and boxes that will help you practice Active Directory penetration testing.

It turns out there are many boxes on Hack the Box that cover aspects of hacking or enumerating Active Directory. As well, there are some courses on how to enumerate and hack Active Directory on Hack the Box.
