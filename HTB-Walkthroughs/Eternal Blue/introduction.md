# Eternal Blue

EternalBlue is a notorious Windows vulnerability that was first discovered in 2017 and has had a significant impact on computer security. This vulnerability primarily affects the Microsoft Windows operating system, particularly versions that lack the latest security updates. EternalBlue exploits a flaw in the Windows Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is used for sharing files and printers across a network. When exploited, it allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system without user interaction.

One of the most infamous exploits that leveraged the EternalBlue vulnerability was the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017. WannaCry rapidly spread across the globe, infecting hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries, causing widespread panic and financial damage. Microsoft subsequently released emergency patches to address the vulnerability, but many organizations had failed to apply these updates in a timely manner, highlighting the importance of regular system patching and updates to mitigate such threats.

EternalBlue serves as a stark reminder of the critical role that cybersecurity plays in today's interconnected world. It underscores the necessity of promptly applying security patches and maintaining up-to-date software to protect against the ever-evolving threats posed by cybercriminals.
