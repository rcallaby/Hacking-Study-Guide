"Granny" is a vulnerable virtual machine (VM) hosted on the Hack The Box platform, designed for ethical hacking and penetration testing purposes. This particular box, "Granny," showcases a variety of cybersecurity challenges and vulnerabilities, providing an opportunity for users to practice their skills in a controlled environment.

The vulnerability on the "Granny" box primarily revolves around the use of a deprecated and unpatched software component. Specifically, the box is configured with an outdated version of the MiniServ web server, which has known security flaws. Attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the system and execute arbitrary code. Additionally, misconfigured file permissions and weak authentication mechanisms contribute to the box's overall insecurity.

"Granny" demonstrates the importance of regular software updates and proper system configuration as essential components of a robust cybersecurity strategy. It emphasizes the risks associated with neglecting security patches and the consequences of using deprecated software. By exploiting these weaknesses, users can practice various penetration testing techniques, hone their skills in privilege escalation, and gain a better understanding of how real-world systems can be compromised, all within a controlled and ethical environment provided by Hack The Box.
