# Grandpa

"Grandpa" is a retired virtual machine (VM) on the popular penetration testing platform, Hack The Box. This challenging box, created by mrb3n, focuses on demonstrating the exploitation of a Windows machine with multiple vulnerabilities.

To gain initial access, the attacker typically leverages a well-known vulnerability called "MS08-067," which is a critical vulnerability in Microsoft Windows' Server service. This security flaw allows remote code execution on Windows machines and has been widely exploited in the past. Once the attacker successfully exploits this vulnerability, they can establish a foothold on the system.

"Grandpa" serves as a valuable training ground for aspiring penetration testers and security professionals by showcasing the real-world exploitation of a legacy Windows vulnerability. It reinforces the importance of timely patching and highlights the potential risks associated with unpatched systems. By exploiting this box, participants can learn about vulnerability assessment, exploit development, and privilege escalation techniques in a controlled environment, enhancing their skills in offensive cybersecurity.
