# Startup Applications

Startup applications are programs that are automatically launched when a user logs into a computer. These programs can be useful for penetration testers because they can provide insight into what software is running on a system and potentially reveal vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

There are a few different ways that startup applications can be accessed and analyzed. In this article, we'll discuss two methods: using the Windows Task Manager and using the Sysinternals Suite's Autoruns tool.

## Using the Windows Task Manager

The Windows Task Manager is a built-in tool in Windows that allows users to view and manage running processes, as well as startup applications. Here's how to use it to analyze startup applications:

+ Open the Task Manager by right-clicking on the taskbar and selecting "Task Manager" or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc.

+ Click on the "Startup" tab to view the list of startup applications.

+ Sort the list by name, publisher, or startup impact by clicking on the corresponding column header.

+ Right-click on an application to disable, enable, or open its file location.

+ Use an online search engine to research any suspicious startup applications and determine if they are legitimate or potentially malicious.

## Using the Sysinternals Suite's Autoruns tool

The Sysinternals Suite is a collection of advanced system utilities developed by Microsoft. One of these utilities is Autoruns, which allows users to view and manage all startup applications, including those that are not listed in the Task Manager. Here's how to use it:

+ Download and extract the Sysinternals Suite from Microsoft's website.

+ Run the Autoruns.exe file as an administrator.

+ Autoruns will scan the system and display a list of all startup applications, organized by category.

+ Use the checkboxes to enable or disable specific startup applications.

+ Double-click on an application to view its properties, including its file location and command-line arguments.

+ Use an online search engine to research any suspicious startup applications and determine if they are legitimate or potentially malicious.


Analyzing startup applications can be a valuable part of a penetration tester's toolkit. By using the Windows Task Manager or the Sysinternals Suite's Autoruns tool, testers can gain insight into what software is running on a system and identify potential vulnerabilities. It's important to remember that not all startup applications are malicious, and research should be done to determine the legitimacy of any suspicious applications before taking action.
