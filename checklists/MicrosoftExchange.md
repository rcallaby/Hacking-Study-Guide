Sure, here's an expanded checklist for Microsoft Exchange used in the CyberSecurity field. I'll provide detailed steps and considerations for each item:

# Microsoft Exchange CyberSecurity Checklist

### 1. Check to see if any patches have been missed
- **Step 1**: Review the current patch level against the latest cumulative updates and security patches provided by Microsoft.
  - **Resources**: Microsoft’s official security update guide, Microsoft Update Catalog.
  - **Tools**: PowerShell script for querying installed updates (`Get-HotFix`), or third-party vulnerability management tools like Nessus or Qualys.
- **Step 2**: Identify missing patches and prioritize based on criticality.
  - **Considerations**: Review CVEs associated with the missing patches and assess the risk they pose to your environment.
- **Step 3**: Plan and schedule patching.
  - **Considerations**: Ensure to have a rollback plan, test patches in a staging environment before applying them to production.

### 2. Check scheduled tasks
- **Step 1**: Enumerate all scheduled tasks on the Exchange server.
  - **Tools**: `Get-ScheduledTask` PowerShell cmdlet.
- **Step 2**: Review the purpose of each scheduled task and ensure they are legitimate.
  - **Considerations**: Look for tasks that run with elevated privileges or are set to run scripts and executables.
- **Step 3**: Investigate and disable any suspicious or unnecessary tasks.
  - **Considerations**: Cross-reference with known good configurations and typical attack vectors (e.g., tasks created by malware).

### Perform Recon

#### Local domain name
- **Step 1**: Determine the local domain name.
  - **Tools**: `nltest /dclist:`, `Get-ADDomain` PowerShell cmdlet.
- **Considerations**: Verify against documented network architecture and configurations.

#### Check the version
- **Step 1**: Identify the current version of Microsoft Exchange.
  - **Tools**: `Get-ExchangeServer` PowerShell cmdlet, `Get-MailboxServer` for mailbox role versions.
- **Considerations**: Verify the version against the list of supported versions and known vulnerabilities.

### Brute Force Attacks

#### Use MailSniper Enum
- **Step 1**: Use MailSniper to enumerate valid email addresses and other information.
  - **Tools**: MailSniper (`Invoke-MailSniper`).
- **Considerations**: Use in a controlled environment to avoid detection by IDS/IPS systems.

#### Password Spray
- **Step 1**: Perform a password spray attack.
  - **Tools**: MailSniper, Hydra, or custom scripts.
- **Considerations**: Monitor account lockouts and throttle the attack to avoid detection. Use common passwords and avoid targeting admin accounts first.

#### Python NTLM password spray
- **Step 1**: Use a Python script to perform NTLM password spray attacks.
  - **Tools**: Custom Python scripts, `ntlmrelayx`.
- **Considerations**: Ensure you have permission to perform such tests and avoid disrupting legitimate access.

### Look at the GAL (Global Address List)

#### Use exchanger.py impacket
- **Step 1**: Use the `exchanger.py` script from the Impacket toolkit to query the GAL.
  - **Tools**: Impacket toolkit.
- **Considerations**: Ensure compliance with usage policies and monitor for any abnormal activity triggered by the script.

#### Use ruler
- **Step 1**: Use the Ruler tool to interact with the Exchange server.
  - **Tools**: Ruler (`ruler --domain example.com --user user@example.com --password pass`).
- **Considerations**: Test in a non-production environment first to understand its impact.

#### Use ewsManage.py
- **Step 1**: Use `ewsManage.py` to manage and interact with Exchange Web Services (EWS).
  - **Tools**: EWSManage script from GitHub.
- **Considerations**: Be cautious of the data retrieved and ensure it is stored securely.

### ProxyLogon
- **Step 1**: Check for indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to ProxyLogon vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-27065).
  - **Tools**: Microsoft’s ProxyLogon script, third-party detection tools.
- **Considerations**: Ensure patches are applied and check for web shells or other malicious artifacts.

### ProxyShell
- **Step 1**: Assess for ProxyShell vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207).
  - **Tools**: Microsoft’s guidance, PowerShell scripts to check for vulnerable configurations.
- **Considerations**: Apply necessary patches and review firewall and access controls.

### Webshell
- **Step 1**: Search for web shells on the Exchange server.
  - **Tools**: File integrity monitoring tools, manual inspection of web directories (`C:\inetpub\wwwroot`).
- **Considerations**: Regularly scan and monitor for unusual file changes. Investigate and remove any found web shells.

### Additional Considerations
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Ensure robust logging is enabled for Exchange-related activities and regularly review logs for suspicious activities.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Verify that backups are working correctly and perform regular restore tests.
- **Security Hardening**: Follow best practices for Exchange hardening, such as disabling unnecessary services, applying the principle of least privilege, and securing access controls.
