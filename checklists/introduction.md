# Checklists

Using Checklists can be an invaluable resource for any penetration tester or bug bounty hunter. The reason being is that you sometimes cannot remmeber every single thing you should do on any particular engagement. By using checklists you get rid of any possibility that you may have missed something, or at least lessened that possibility.

These checklists are a work in progress and may be added to on a gradual basis. If you are reading this and want to contribute to these checklists, feel free to submit a Pull Request or even better create a ticket where you state your intentions.

If you find these checklists to be helpful, or you find this repository to be helpful please consider giving it a star.
